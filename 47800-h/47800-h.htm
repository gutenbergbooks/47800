    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the time of his death, my brother had proceeded but a little way in
      this task which he and I began together, and I must frankly own my
      inability to cope with it on the lines which he would doubtless have
      followed. It is probable, for example, that his unrivalled knowledge of
      "the memories, legends, ballads, and nature of the Border" would have led
      him to show various important events in a light different from that in
      which my less intimate acquaintance with the past has enabled me to speak
      of them; whilst, as regards the Ballad literature of the Border, I cannot
      pretend to that expert knowledge which he possessed, I do not think,
      therefore, it is fitting that I should attempt to carry out his intention
      to deal more fully with those of the Ballads which are most closely
      connected with places treated of in this volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him, more perhaps than to any other Borderer, every burn and stream,
      every glen and hill of that pleasant land was
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      ". . . lull ot ballad notes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Borne out of long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is many a year since he wrote those verses wherein he spoke of
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      " Old songs that sung themselves to me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Sweet through a boy's day-dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not alone in a boy's day-dream that they sounded. To the end,
      they echoed and re-echoed in his heart, and no voice ever spoke to him so
      eloquently as that of Tweed,&mdash;by whose banks, indeed, in a spot
      greatly loved, had it been permitted he would fain have slept his long
      sleep.

      CHAPTER I BERWICK, TWEED, WHITADDER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he "Border" is a
      magical word, and on either side of a line that constantly varied in the
      course of English and Scottish victories and defeats, all is enchanted
      ground, the home of memories of forays and fairies, of raids and
      recoveries, of loves and battles long ago. In the most ancient times of
      which record remains, the English sway, on the east, might extend to and
      include Edinburgh; and Forth, or even Tay, might be the southern boundary
      of the kingdom of the Scots. On the west, Strathclyde, originally Cymric
      or Welsh, might extend over Cumberland; and later Scottish kings might
      hold a contested superiority over that province. Between east and west, in
      the Forest of Ettrick, the place-names prove ownership in the past by men
      of English speech, of Cymric speech, and of Gaelic speech. From a single
      point of view you may see Penchrise (Welsh) Glengaber (Gaelic) and
      Skelfhill (English). Once the Border, hereabouts, ran slantwise, from Peel
      Fell in the Cheviots, across the Slitrig, a water which joins Teviot at<span
      class="pagenum">002</span><a name="link002" id="link002"></a>Hawick,
      thence across Teviot to Commonside Hill above Branksome tower, to the
      Rankle burn, near Buccleuch, an affluent of Ettrick. Thence, across
      Ettrick and Yarrow, over Minchmuir, where Montrose rode after the disaster
      at Philiphaugh, across Tweed, past the camp of Rink, to Torwoodlee, goes
      that ancient Border, marked by the ancient dyke called the Catrail, in
      which Sir Walter Scott once had a bad fall during his "grand rides among
      the hills," when he beat out the music of <i>Marmion</i> to the
      accompaniment of his horse's hooves. The Catrail was a Border, once, and
      is a puzzle, owing to its ditch between two ramparts. There are many hill
      forts, mounds even now strong and steep in some places, on the line of the
      Catrail. The learned derive the word from Welsh <i>cad</i>, Gaelic <i>Cath</i>,
      "a battle," and some think that the work defended the Border of the
      Christian Cymric folk of Strathclyde from the pagan English of
      Northumbria. In that case, Sir Herbert Maxwell has expressed the pious
      hope that "the Britons were better Christians than they were military
      engineers." Is it inconceivable that the word Catrail is a mere old
      English nickname for a ditch which they did not understand, <i>the cat's
      trail</i>, like Catslack, the wild cat's gap, and other local cat names? I
      am no philologist!
    </p>
    <p>
      Once when taking a short cut across a hill round which the road runs from
      Branksome to Skelfhill, I came upon what looked like the deeply cut banks
      of an extinct burn. There was no water, and the dyke was not continued
      above or below. Walking on I met an old gentleman sketching a group of
      hill forts, artificial mounds, and asked him what this inexplicable deep
      cutting might be. "It is the Catrail," he said: I had often heard of it,
      and now I had seen it. The old man went on to show that the Border is
      still a haunted place. "Man, a queer thing happened to me on Friday nicht.
      I was sleeping at Tushielaw Inn, (on the Upper Ettrick) I had steikit the
      door and the windows: I woke in the middle o' the nicht,&mdash;there <span
      class="pagenum">003</span><a name="link003" id="link003"></a>was a body in
      the bed wi' me!" (I made a flippant remark. He took no notice of it.) "I
      got up and lit the candle, and looked. There was naebody in the bed. I
      fell asleep, and wakened again. The body was there, it <i>yammered</i>. I
      canna comprehend it." Nor can I, but a pah of amateur psychical
      researchers hastened to sleep a night at Tushielaw. <i>They</i> were
      undisturbed; and the experience of the old antiquary was "for this
      occasion only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My work seeks digressions," says Herodotus, and mine has already wandered
      far north of the old Border line of Tweed on the east, and Esk on the
      western marches, far into what was once the great forest of Ettrick, and
      now is mainly pasture land, <i>pastorum loca vasta</i>. In the old days of
      the Catrail and the hill forts this territory, "where victual never grew,"
      must have been more thickly populated than it has been in historic times.

      We may best penetrate it by following the ancient natural tracks, by the
      sides of Tweed and its tributaries. We cross the picturesque bridge of
      Tweed at Berwick to the town which first became part of the kingdom of
      Scotland, when Malcolm II, at Carham fight, won Lothian from Northumbria.
      That was in 1018, nine centuries agone. Thenceforward Berwick was one of
      the four most important places of Scottish <span class="pagenum">004</span><a
      name="link004" id="link004"></a>trade; the Scots held it while they might,
      the English took it when they could; the place changed hands several
      times, to the infinite distress of a people inured to siege and sack. They
      must have endured much when Malcolm mastered it; and again, in 1172, when
      Richard de Lacy and Humphrey de Bohun, at war with William the Lion,
      burned the town. William, after he inadvertently, in a morning mist,
      charged the whole English army at Alnwick, and was captured, surrendered
      Berwick to England, by the Treaty of Falaise, when he did homage for his
      whole kingdom. The English strongly fortified the place, though the
      fragments of the girdling wall near the railway station, are, I presume,
      less ancient than the end of the twelfth century. William bought all back
      again from the crusading Richard of the Lion Heart: the two kings were
      "well matched for a pair of lions," but William the Lion was old by this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1216, Alexander II attacked England at Norham Castle, but King John,
      though seldom victorious, was man enough to drive Alexander off, and brute
      enough to sack Berwick with great cruelty, setting a lighted torch to the
      thatch of the house in which he had lain; and "making a jolly fire," as a
      general of Henry VIII later described his own conduct at Edinburgh. Fifty
      years later the woman-hating friar who wrote <i>The Chronicle of Lanercost</i>
      describes Berwick as the Alexandria of the period; the Tweed, flowing
      still and shallow, taking the place of the majestic river of Egypt. One is
      reminded of the Peebles man who, after returning from a career in India,
      was seen walking sadly on Peebles Bridge. "I'm a leear," he said, "an unco
      leear. In India I telled them a' that Tweed at Peebles was wider than the
      Ganges!" And he had believed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Berwick <i>was</i> the Scottish Alexandria, and paid into the
      coffers of the last of her "Kings of Peace," Alexander III, an almost
      incredible amount of customs dues. After three peaceful reigns, Scotland
      was a wealthy country, and Berwick was her chief emporium. But then came
      the death of the <span class="pagenum">005</span><a name="link005"
      id="link005"></a>Maid of Norway, the usurpation by Edward I, the endless
      wars for Independence: and Berwick became one of the cockpits of the long
      strife, while Scotland, like St. Francis, was the mate of Poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Edward was in France, his "toom tabard," King John, (Balliol)
      renounced his allegiance. Edward came home and, in the last days of March
      1296, crossed Tweed and beleaguered Berwick, in which were many trading
      merchants of Flanders. The townsfolk burned several of his ships, and sang
      songs of which the meaning was coarse, and the language, though libellous,
      was rather obscure. Edward was not cruel, as a rule, but, irritated by the
      check, the insults, and the reported murder by the Scots of English
      merchants, he gave orders for a charge. The ditch and stockade were
      carried, and a general massacre followed, of which horrible tales are told
      by a late rhyming chronicler. Hemingburgh, on the English side, says that
      the women were to some extent protected. The Scots avenged themselves in
      the same fashion at Corbridge, that old Roman station, but the glory and
      wealth of Berwick were gone, the place retaining only its military
      importance. To Berwick Edward II fled after Bannockburn, as rapidly as Sir
      John Cope sought the same refuge after Prestonpans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berwick is, for historically minded tourists, (not a large proportion of
      the whole), a place of many memories. In July, 1318, Bruce took the castle
      after a long blockade; an English attempt to recover it was defeated
      mainly through the skill of Crab, a Flemish military engineer. Guns were
      not yet in use: "crakkis of war," (guns) were first heard in Scotland,
      near Berwick, in 1327. In 1333, after a terrible defeat of the Scots on
      the slopes of Halidon Hill, a short distance north of Berwick, the place
      surrendered to Edward III, and became the chief magazine of the English in
      their Scottish wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1461, the Scots recovered it, but in 1481, the nobles of James III
      mutinied at Lauder bridge, hanged his favourites, and made no attempt to
      drive Crook-backed Richard from his <span class="pagenum">006</span><a
      name="link006" id="link006"></a>siege of Berwick. Since then the town has
      been in English hands, and was to them, for Scottish wars, a Calais or a
      Gibraltar. The present bridge of fifteen arches, the most beautiful
      surviving relic here of old days, was built under James VI and I.

      They say that the centre of the railway station covers the site of the
      hall of the castle of Edward I, in which that prince righteously awarded
      the crown of Scotland to John Balliol. The town long used the castle as a
      quarry, then came the railway, and destroyed all but a few low walls, mere
      hummocks, and the Bell Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally the ancient churches perished after the Blessed Reformation:
      indeed the castle was used as a quarry for a new church of the period of
      the Civil War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately above Berwick, and for some distance, Tweed flows between flat
      banks, diffusely and tamely: the pools are locally styled "dubs," and
      deserve the title. The anti-Scottish satirist, Churchill, says, <span
      class="pagenum">007</span><a name="link007" id="link007"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Waft me, some Muse, to Tweed's inspiring stream
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Where, slowly winding, the dull waters creep
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And seem themselves to own the power of sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," replies a patriotic Scot, "'the glittering and resolute streams
      of Tweed,' as an old Cromwellian trooper and angler, Richard Franck,
      styles them, are only dull and sleepy in the dubs where England provides
      their flat southern bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not flat, however, are the banks on either side of Whitadder, Tweed's
      first tributary, which joins that river two or three miles above Berwick.
      From its source in the Lammermuirs, almost to its mouth, a distance of
      between thirty and forty miles, the Whitadder is quite an ideal trouting
      stream, "sore fished" indeed, and below Chirnside, injured, one fears, by
      discharge from Paper Mills there, yet full of rippling streams and
      boulder-strewn pools that make one itch to throw a fly over them. But most
      of the water is open to the public, and on days when local angling
      competitions are held it is no uncommon sight to see three, or maybe four,
      competitors racing for one stream or pool, the second splashing in and
      whipping the water in front of the first, regardless of unwritten sporting
      law; a real case of "deil tak the hindmost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Free-fishing" no doubt, from some points of view, is a thing to be
      desired, but to him who can remember old times, when the anglers he met in
      the course of a day's fishing might easily be counted on the fingers of
      one hand, the change now is sad. Yet men, they say, do still in the open
      stretches of Whitadder catch "a pretty dish" now and again. They must be
      very early birds, one would suppose&mdash;and perhaps they fish with the
      lure that the early bird is known to pick up.
    </p>
    <p>
      On both sides of Whitadder are to be seen places of much interest. First,
      Edrington Castle, on the left bank a few miles from the river's mouth,
      once a place of great strength, now crushed by the doom that has wrecked
      so many of the old strongholds in this part of the country&mdash;it was
      for ages used as <span class="pagenum">008</span><a name="link008"
      id="link008"></a>a convenient quarry. Then, on the right bank, higher up,
      on an eminence overhanging the stream, stands Hutton Hall, a picturesque
      old keep of the fifteenth century, with additions of later date. The
      original tower was probably built by the Lord Home, who obtained the lands
      in 1467 by his marriage with the daughter of George Ker of Samuelton.
      Nearly opposite Hutton, about a mile away, are the ruins of an old castle
      at Edington. It is remarkable the number of names in this district, all
      beginning with "Ed":&mdash;Edrington, Edington, Ednam, Eden, Edrom,
      Edinshall, all probably taking their origin from Edwin, king of
      Northumbria, 626-633. Or does the derivation go still further back, to
      Odin?
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher up, we come to Allanton and the junction of Whitadder with its
      tributary, Blackadder. Near this lies Allanbank, haunt for many
      generations of that apparition so famous in Scotland, "Pearlin Jean."
      Jean, or rather Jeanne, it is said, was a beautiful young French lady, in
      Paris or elsewhere loved and left by a wicked Baronet of Allanbank, Sir
      Robert Stuart. The tale is some hundreds of years old, but "Pearlin Jean"
      and her pathetic story still retain their hold on the imagination of
      Border folk. The legend goes that when the false lover, after a violent
      scene, deserted his bride that should have been, the poor lady
      accidentally met her death, but not before she had vowed that she would
      "be in Scotland before him." And sure enough, the first thing that greeted
      the horrified gaze of the baronet as he crossed the threshold of his home,
      bringing another bride than her he had loved and left, wras the dim form
      of Jeanne, all decked, as had ever been her wont, in the rich lace that
      she loved, and from which the apparition derived the name of Pearlin Jean,
      "pearlin" being the Scottish term for lace. Tradition says nothing as to
      the end of the false lover, but the ghost was still known&mdash;so say the
      country people&mdash;to have haunted the house until it was pulled down
      sometime early in last century. Sir Thomas Dick Lauder in his "Scottish
      Rivers" tells how <span class="pagenum">009</span><a name="link009"
      id="link009"></a>an old woman then anxiously enquired: "Where will Pearlin
      Jean gang noo when the house is dismolished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the tale of "Pearlin Jean" as it is generally told. There is
      another story, however, less known but much more probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reckless extravagance of succeeding generations ended as it
      always must end; when cards and dire and the facile aid of wine and women
      had sent bit after bit of the broad lands of an old family into alien
      keeping, and not tardily the day had come when the last acre slipped
      through heedless fingers, and even the household furniture&mdash;all that
      remained to the last Baronet of Allanbank&mdash;was brought to the hammer,
      there was one room in the old house into which, ere the gloaming fell, the
      country folk peered with awe greater even than their curiosity. It was a
      room in which for near on two generations the dust had been left to lie
      undisturbed on table and chair and mantel-shelf, a room whose little
      diamond shaped window panes the storms of more than fifty winters had
      dimmed, and on whose hearth still lay the ashes of a fire quenched half a
      century back. Here it was that Pearlin Jean had passed those few not
      unhappy months of her life, while yet a false lover was not openly untrue
      to her. But into this chamber, since Jean quilted it for the last time no
      servant would venture by day or by night, unaccompanied, lest in it might
      be seen the wraith of that unfortunate and much wronged lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a story common enough, unhappily, that of Jeanne. She was the
      daughter of a Flemish Jew, very beautiful, very young, very light-hearted
      and loving, and unsuspecting of evil, of a disposition invincibly generous
      and self-sacrificing. In an evil hour the Fates threw across her path Sir
      Robert Stuart of Allanbank, then visiting the Hague during his travels on
      the Continent. Sir Robert was a man now no longer in his first youth,
      self-indulgent, callous of the feelings and rights of others where they
      ran athwart his own wants or desires, one <span class="pagenum">010</span><a
      name="link010" id="link010"></a>to whom the seamy side of life had long
      been as an open book. His crop of wild oats, indeed, was ere now of
      rankest growth, and already on the face of the sower were lines that told
      of the toil of sowing. But he was a handsome man, with a fluent, honeyed
      tongue, and it did not take him long to steal the heart from one who, like
      the poor little Jeanne, suspected no evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Merse and to Allanbank there came word that the land was returning
      to his home. The house was to be put in order, great preparations to be
      made. No doubt, folk thought, all pointed to a wedding in the near future;
      the wild young baronet was about to settle down at last&mdash;and not
      before it was time, if what folk said regarding his last visit to
      Allanbank might be trusted. But the local newsmongers were wrong, in this
      instance at least of the home-coming and what might be expected to follow.
      When Sir Robert's great coach lumbered up to the door of Allanbank, there
      stepped down, not the baronet alone, but a very beautiful young woman, a
      vision all in lace and ribbons, whom the wondering servants were
      instructed to regard in future as their mistress. And though neighbours&mdash;with
      a few male exceptions&mdash;of course kept severely aloof, steadily
      ignoring the scandalous household of Allanbank, yet after a time, in spite
      of the fact that no plain gold band graced the third finger of Jeanne's
      left hand, servants, and the country folk generally, came to have a great
      liking, and even an affection, for the kindly little foreign lass with the
      merry grey eyes and the sunny hair, and the quaintly tripping tongue. And
      for a time Jeanne was happy, singing gaily enough from morning to night
      some one or other of her numberless sweet old French <i>chansons.</i> She
      had the man she adored; what mattered neighbours? And so the summer slid
      by.
    </p>

      But before the autumn there came a change. The merry lass was no longer so
      merry, songs came less often from her lips, tears that she could not hide
      more and more often <span class="pagenum">011</span><a name="link011"
      id="link011"></a>brimmed over from her eyes; and day by day her lover
      seemed to become more short in the temper and less considerate of her
      feelings, more inclined to be absent from home. In a word, he was bored,
      and he was not the man to conceal it. Then when April was come, and the
      touch of Spring flushed every bare twig in copse or wooded bank down by
      the pools where trout lay feeding, when thrush and blackbird, perched high
      on topmost hough, poured out their hearts in a glory of song that rose and
      fell on the still evening air, a little daughter lay in Jeanne's arms, and
      happiness again for a brief space was hers. But not for long. The ardour
      born anew in her man's self-engrossed heart soon died down. To him now it
      seemed merely that a squalling infant had been added to his already almost
      insufferable burden of a peevish woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more, Jeanne was left to her own society and to the not
      inadequate solace of her little child. Then "business" took Stuart to
      Edinburgh. Months passed, and he did not return; nor did Jeanne once hear
      of him. But there came at last for her a day black and terrible, when the
      very foundations of her little world crumbled and became as the dust that
      drives before the wind. From Edinburgh came a mounted messenger, bearing a
      letter, written by his man of business, which told the unhappy girl that
      Sir Robert Stuart was about to be married to one in his own rank of life;
      that due provision should be made for the child, and sufficient allowance
      settled on herself, provided that she returned to her own country and
      refrained from causing further scandal or trouble. She made no outcry,
      poor lass; none witnessed her bitter grief that night. But in the morning,
      she and the child were gone, and on her untouched bed lay the lace and the
      jewels she once had liked to wear because in early days it had pleased her
      to hear the man she loved say that she looked well in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went by, and Stuart, unheeding of public opinion, brought his bride
      to Allanbank. Of Jeanne he had had <span class="pagenum">012</span><a
      name="link012" id="link012"></a>no word; she had disappeared&mdash;opportunely
      enough, he thought. Probably she had long ago gone back to her own land,
      and by this time the countryside had perhaps found some other nine days'
      wonder to cackle over. So he returned, driving up to the house in great
      state&mdash;as once before he had driven up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely an ill-omened home-coming, this, for the new bride! As the horses
      dashed up the avenue, past little groups of gaping country people
      uncertain whether to cheer or to keep silence, suddenly there darted from
      a clump of shrubbery the flying figure of a woman carrying in her arms a
      little child, and ere the postilions could pull up, or any bystander stop
      her, she was down among the feet of the plunging horses, and an iron heel
      had trodden out the life of the woman. It was the trampled body of that
      Jeanne whom he had lightly loved for a time and then tossed aside when
      weary of his toy, that met the horrified gaze of the white-lipped, silent
      man who got hurriedly down from inside that coach, leaving his terrified
      bride to shrink unheeded in her corner. And perhaps now he would have
      given much to undo the past and to make atonement for the wrong he had
      done. At least, he may have thought, there was the child to look after;
      and his heart&mdash;what there was of it&mdash;went out with some show of
      tenderness towards the helpless infant. But here was the beginning of
      strife, for Jeanne's baby did by no means appeal to the new-made bride.
      Nor was that lady best pleased to find in her withdrawing room a fine
      portrait in oils of her unlawful predecessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so there was little peace in that house; and as little comfort as
      peace, for it came to pass that no servant would remain there. From the
      day of her death Pearlin Jean "walked", they said, and none dared enter
      the room which once she had called her own. That, of all places, was where
      she was most certain to be seen. For one day, when the master entered the
      room alone, they that were near heard his <span class="pagenum">013</span><a
      name="link013" id="link013"></a>voice pleading, and when he came out it
      was with a face drawn and grey, and his eyes, they said, gazed into
      vacancy like those of one that sees not. So the place got ever an
      increasingly bad name, and the ghost of the poor unhappy Jeanne could get
      no rest, but went to and fro continually. And long after that day had
      arrived when her betrayer, too, slept with his fathers, the notoriety of
      the affair waxed so great that seven learned ministers, tradition says,
      united vainly in efforts to lay the unquiet spirit of Pearlin Jean. So
      long as the old house stood, there, they will tell you, might her ghost be
      seen, pathetically constant to the place of her sorrow. And there may not
      be wanting, even now, those who put faith in the possibility of her
      slender figure being seen as it glides through the trees where the old
      house of Allanbank once stood.

      Some miles above Allanton, on the left bank of Whitadder, stands Blanerne,
      home of a very ancient Scottish family. And farther back from the river
      are the crumbling fragments of Billie Castle&mdash;"Bylie," in twelfth
      century charters,&mdash;and of Bunkle, or, more properly, Bonkyll, Castle.
      All these have met the fate assigned to them by the old local rhyming
      prophecy:

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A cairn each has been, without doubt, or rather a quarry, from which
      material for neighbouring farm buildings has been ruthlessly torn. Of
      Blanerne, I believe the Keep still exists, as well as some other remains,
      to tell of what has been; but Billie Castle is now little more than a
      green mound at foot of which runs a more or less swampy burn, with here
      and there a fragment of massive wall still standing; whilst Bunkle is a
      mere rubble of loose stones. AH these were destroyed in Hertford's <span
      class="pagenum">014</span><a name="link014" id="link014"></a>raid in 1544,
      when so much of the Border was "birnd and owaiertrown."

      More ruthless than Hertford's, however, was the work at Bunkle of our own
      people in 1820. They pulled down an eleventh century church in order to
      build the present edifice. Only a fragment of the original building
      remains, but many of its carved stones may be seen in the walls of the
      existing <span class="pagenum">015</span><a name="link015" id="link015"></a>church.
      Possibly the old structure was in a bad state of repair. One does not know
      for certain; but at date of its demolition the building appears to have
      been entire.

      Our ancestors of a hundred years ago were not to be "lippened to" where
      ecclesiastical remains were concerned. They had what amounted to a passion
      for pulling down anything that was old, and where they did not pull down,
      they generally covered with hideous plaster any inside wall or ornamental
      work, which to them perhaps might savour of "papistry." Parish ministers,
      even late in the eighteenth and early in the nineteenth centuries, appear
      to have taken no interest in those beautiful Norman remains, numerous
      fragments of which even now exist in Berwickshire; of all those ministers
      who compiled the old Statistical Account of this county, but one or two
      make any mention of such things. One fears, indeed, that to some of those
      reverend gentlemen, or to others like them of later date, we are indebted
      for the destruction of priceless relics of the past. At Duns, for
      instance, as late as 1874 the original chancel of an old Norman church was
      pulled down by order of the incumbent, "to improve the church-yard." Then,
      as already mentioned, there is Bunkle, an instance of very early Norman
      work, pulled down in 1820. At Chirnside, the tower of its Norman church
      was sacrificed in 1750. though great part of the old church walls remain;
      in the south side is a Norman doorway six feet ten inches in height to the
      lintel and two feet ten and three-quarter inches wide. Of Edrom church, a
      very beautiful Norman doorway, said to be "the finest of its style in
      Scotland," has been preserved, entirely owing, apparently, to <span
      class="pagenum">016</span><a name="link016" id="link016"></a>the fact that
      it had been made the entrance to a burial vault. At Legerwood, near
      Earlstoun, where stands the chancel of a Norman church, the arch is still
      entire but is defaced with plaster. Berwickshire, however, is not the only
      part of the Border where such things have been done.

      Higher up Tweed, at Stobo in Peeblesshire, there is an interesting old
      church of Norman structure, with sixteenth and seventeenth century
      alterations; roof and interior fittings are modern, and the building is
      still used as the Parish Church. Sixteenth and seventeenth century
      alterations have now at least age to commend them, but it is difficult to
      see what plea can be advanced for some of those of comparatively recent
      date. According to "Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland," the most
      serious injury inflicted on the building was the entire destruction of the
      Norman chancel arch, in order to insert a modern pointed one, at the
      restoration of the church in 1868.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over in Teviotdale, too, the same passion for altering, or for sweeping
      away relics of old times, ran its course. In 1762, the Town Council of
      Hawick gave orders for the destruction of the Town's Cross. So Popish a
      thing as a Cross could not be <span class="pagenum">017</span><a
      name="link017" id="link017"></a>tolerated by those worthy and "unco" pious
      persons. The treasurer's accounts of the time show that tenpence per day
      was paid to two men for the work of taking down the Cross, and the carved
      stones seem to have been sold afterwards for eleven shillings and
      sixpence. No doubt the worthy bailies congratulated themselves on having
      not only rid the town of an emblem of Popery, but on having made quite a
      handsome monetary profit over the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Whitadder. In his "Scottish Rivers," Sir Thomas Dick
      Lauder writes of Billy Castle as the scene of a grisly tale connected with
      the Homes. He tells how, to the best of his reckoning about a century
      prior to the date at which he wrote, an old lady of that family resided
      here in a somewhat friendless condition, but with a considerable household
      of servants, chief of whom was a butler who had been in her service for
      many years, and in whose integrity she had entire confidence. This old
      lady, it seems, was in the habit of personally collecting rents from her
      tenants, and as there were then no country banks in which to deposit the
      money, it was her custom to count it in presence of the butler, prior to
      locking the guineas away in a strong cupboard in her bedroom. The door of
      this room was secured by an ingenious arrangement, whereby a heavy brass
      bolt, or cylinder, was allowed to fall by its own weight into an opening
      made exactly to fit it. To an eye in the head of the cylinder was attached
      a cord which worked through a pulley fastened to the ceiling, and thence
      by a series of running blocks passed to the bedside. Thus the old lady,
      without troubling to get out of bed, could bolt or unbolt her door at
      will, and so long as the cylinder was down, no one could possibly enter
      the room. Now, the butler had for years witnessed this counting and
      stowing away of the rent monies, and temptation had never yet assailed
      him. He might, indeed, plume himself on his honesty, and say with Verges:
      "I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old <span
      class="pagenum">018</span><a name="link018" id="link018"></a>man and no
      honester than I." But alas! there came a night when the guineas chinked
      too seductively, and the devil whispered in the butler's ear. Perhaps some
      small financial embarrassment of his own was troubling the man. Anyhow, it
      came to his mind that if he could quietly fill up the hole into which the
      bolt of his mistress's bedroom door dropped, he might help himself to as
      much money as he needed. The time of year was the cherry season. What so
      easy as to fill up the bolt hole with cherry stones? The "geans" grew
      thick in Scotland, and they were black ripe now. "At midnight," says Sir
      Thomas, "he stole into his mistress's chamber, cut her throat from ear to
      ear, broke open her cabinet, and possessed himself of her money; and
      although he might have walked down stairs and out at the door without
      exciting either alarm or suspicion, he opened the window and let himself
      down nearly two stories high, broke his leg, and lay thus among the
      shrubbery till morning, without ever attempting to crawl away. He was
      seized, tried, condemned, and executed."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is grisly enough, but hardly so grisly as the real story of what
      happened. The scene of the murder, however, was not Billy Castle&mdash;which,
      indeed, had then been dismantled and in ruins for two hundred years&mdash;but
      Linthill House, a fine old mansion standing on a "brae" overhanging
      Eye-water, five or six miles from Billy. Linthill is now inhabited by
      families of work-people, but it is still in good preservation, and at date
      of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's story (1752), must have been a very-fine
      specimen of the old Scottish château.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady's room was entered as Sir Thomas describes, but the butler
      did not immediately cut her throat. She was awakened by the sound of the
      stealthy rifling of the cupboard, or strong iron-bound box, in which her
      valuables were kept, and with that pluck which is characteristic of the
      old-time Scottish lady, she jumped up to grapple with the robber. Then he
      cut her throat, and leaving her for dead on the bed, <span class="pagenum">019</span><a
      name="link019" id="link019"></a>proceeded with his rifling. A slight
      noise, nowever, disturbed him, and, looking round, a terrifying sight met
      his gaze; the woman whom he had believed to be dead was on her feet,
      blindly groping her bloody way along the wall to the bell. Before he could
      seize her and complete his work, she had pulled the rope with all the
      strength left to her, and had alarmed the other servants. Thus the
      murderer had no opportunity to leave by way of the stairs. He jumped from
      the window&mdash;no great feat for an active man with his wits about him.
      But the butler was flurried; perhaps, also, he was stout, as is not
      uncommon with pampered servants. In any case, he missed his footing, came
      down badly, and broke his leg. He did not, however, lie where he fell,
      inert and helpless. With painful, effort the man dragged himself to a
      field near by, where, amongst sweet-scented flowering beans, he lay
      concealed for some days. On the fourth day, as he lay groaning beside a
      tiny spring of water which still flows near the middle of the field, he
      chanced to be seen by some children, who gave information. The wretched
      man was taken, tried, and executed&mdash;the last instance in Scotland of
      a criminal being hung in chains. The blood of a murdered person, they say,
      refuses to be washed clean from any wood-work into which it may have
      soaked&mdash;witness that ghastly dark patch that disfigures a floor in
      Holyrood. Here at Linthill at least there is no doubt of the fact that
      those marks remain; in spite of very visible attempts to remove the stains
      from the wood-work by planing them out, the prints of the poor lady's
      bloody hands still cling to the oak wainscoting of the gloomy old room
      where the deed was committed. About house and grounds there hangs now an
      air of dejection and decay, though Eye ripples cheerily just beyond the
      garden foot and the surrounding landscape is bright with pleasant woods
      and smiling fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely if ever ghost walked, it should be here at Linthill; that midnight
      bell should clang, a window be thrown open, the thud be heard of a heavy
      body falling on the ground. <span class="pagenum">020</span><a
      name="link020" id="link020"></a>But it is not mistress or man that haunts
      that house. It is of other things they tell who have been there; of an
      upper chamber, to which nightly comes the shuffling tramp of men bearing
      from a vehicle which is heard to drive up to the house door, a heavy
      weight, which they deposit on the floor. More shuffling, a room door
      quietly closed, the sound of retreating steps, then silence. "Hout!" say
      the womenfolk of those who now inhabit part of the old house, "it'll no be
      naething." But they look behind them with a glance not too assured, and
      the voice that says t is "naething" is not over-steady in tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little higher up the river than Blanerne we come to Broomhouse, where
      also once stood a castle. In a field on this estate is a spot, still
      called "Bawtie's Grave," where the body of Sir Anthony Darcy&mdash;"Le
      Sieur de la Beauté"&mdash;Warden of the Marches in 1517, is said to lie
      buried. Darcy, or de la Bastie (or de la Beauté), as he was generally
      called, was a Frenchman, a man possessed of great personal beauty and
      attraction; but the fact that he had been appointed Warden of the Marches
      and Captain of Dunbar Castle in room of Lord Home, who had been
      treacherously put to death in Edinburgh, rendered him very obnoxious to
      the inhabitants of that part of Berwickshire in which the Homes held sway.
      It was through Darcy that Lord Home and his brother had been decoyed to
      Edinburgh, said the kin and supporters of the Home family. Vengeance must
      be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was time wasted over it. An occasion soon arose when Darcy in his
      capacity of Warden had to visit Langton Tower, (no great distance from
      Duns), in order to settle some family feud of the Cockburns, relatives by
      marriage of the Homes. Here, outside the tower, Sir David Home, with a
      party of horsemen, came up, and speedily picked a quarrel with the Sieur.
      Swords were out in a minute, and Home's band was too strong for Darcy and
      his men. Several of the French attendants of the Sieur fell, and as the
      rest of his party were mostly Borderers, and therefore not very eager to
      fight for him, the Warden found himself <span class="pagenum">021</span><a
      name="link021" id="link021"></a>compelled to ride for it. He headed in the
      direction of Dunbar. But the ground over which he had to gallop was
      swampy, and de la Beauté's heavy horse sank fetlock deep at every stride,
      finally "bogging" in a morass some distance to the east of Duns. Darcy is
      said to have continued his flight on foot, but the chase did not last
      long; Home and his followers bore down upon him&mdash;a well-mounted
      "little foot-page," they say, the first man up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "The leddies o' France may wail and mourn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

      They were on him at once; his head was fiercely hewn off, carried in
      triumph to Home Castle, and there fastened to the end of a spear on the
      battlements, to gaze blind-eyed over the wide Merse, the land he had tried
      to govern. Pitscottie says that Sir David Home of Wedderburn cut off
      Darcy's long flow ing locks, and plaiting them into a wreath, knit them as
      a trophy to his saddle bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the Sieur in the end got no more than his deserts, or at least no
      more than he may frequently have dealt out to others. He came of a stock
      famed in France for cruelty and oppression; and the peasants round
      Allevard, in the Savoie,&mdash;where stand the fragments of what was once
      his ancestral home&mdash;still tell of that dreadful night when Messire
      Satan himself wras seen to take his stand on the loftiest battlement of
      the castle. And they relate how then the walls rocked and swayed and with
      hideous crash toppled to the ground. Perhaps it was this very catastrophe
      which sent the "Bonny Bawtie" to Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cairn once marked the spot where the Sieur's body found a resting place.
      But, unfortunately, such a ready-made quarry of stones attracted the
      notice of a person who contracted to repair the district roads. It is many
      years ago now, and there was no <span class="pagenum">022</span><a
      name="link022" id="link022"></a>one to say him nay. He carted away the
      interesting land-mark and broke up the cairn into road metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home Castle still dominates this part of the Border, but no longer is it
      the building of "Bawtie's" day. That was pulled down in the time of the
      Protector, by Cromwell's soldiers under Colonel Fenwick. Thomas Cockburn,
      Governor in 1650 when Fenwick summoned the castle to surrender, was
      valiant only on paper; a few rounds from the English guns caused his
      valour to ooze from his fingers' ends, and sent up the white flag. That
      was the end of the old castle. Fenwick dismantled it and pulled down the
      walls; the present building, imposing as it seems, standing grim and erect
      on its rocky height, is but a dummy fortress, built in the early
      eighteenth century on the old foundations, from the old material, by the
      Earl of Marchmont. The original building dated from the thirteenth
      century, and a stormy life it had, like many Border strongholds
      alternately in Scottish and in English hands. In 1547, after a gallant
      defence by the widow of the fourth Lord Home, it was taken by the English
      under Somerset; two years later it was recaptured by that lady's son, the
      fifth Lord Home.

      "Too old at forty," is the cry raised in these days&mdash;presumably by
      those who have not yet attained to that patriarchal age&mdash;but when a
      state of war was the chronic condition of the Border-land, men of vastly
      greater age than forty were not seldom able to show the way to warriors
      young enough to be their grandsons. At this taking of Home Castle in the
      closing days of December 1548, it was a man over sixty, one of the name of
      Home, who was the first to mount the wall. The attack was made at night,
      on the side where the castle was both naturally and artificially
      strongest, and where consequently least vigilant guard might probably be
      kept. As Home, ahead of his comrades, began to slide his body cautiously
      over the parapet, the suspicions of a sentry pacing at some little
      distance were roused, and he challenged and <span class="pagenum">023</span><a
      name="link023" id="link023"></a>turned out the guard. This man had not
      actually <i>seen</i> anything, the night was too dark for that, but he
      had, as it were, <i>smelt</i> danger, with that strange extra sense that
      sometimes in such circumstances raises man more nearly to the level of his
      superior in certain things&mdash;the wild animal. However, in this case
      the sentry got no credit, but only ridicule, from his comrades, for
      examination showed that there was no cause whatever for his having brought
      the guard out into the cold, looking for mares' nests over the ramparts.
      Home and his party had dropped hurriedly back, and during the time that
      the Englishmen were glancing carelessly over the wall, they lay securely
      hidden close at its base. As soon, however, as the English soldiers had
      returned to the snug warmth of their guard-room, and the mortified sentry
      was once more pacing up and down, Home was again the first of the Scots to
      clamber up and to fall upon the astonished Englishman, whom this time he
      slew, a fate which overtook most of the castle's garrison. "Treachery
      helped the assailants," said the English. "Home Castle was taken by night,
      and treason, by the Scots," is the entry in King Edward's Journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in 1569, it was battered by the heavy siege guns of the Earl of
      Sussex and once more for a time was held by-England; finally in 1650 came
      its last experience of war. It was at Home Castle that Mary of Gueldres,
      Queen of James II of Scotland, lay whilst her husband besieged Roxburgh in
      1460. One hundred and six years later, Mary Queen of Scots was there on
      her way to Craigmillar from Jedburgh.

      In days when the bale-fire's red glare on the sky by night, or its heavy
      column of smoke by day, was the only means of warning the country of
      coming invasion from the south, Home Castle, with its wide outlook, was
      the ideal centre of a system of beacon signals on the Scottish border. The
      position was matchless for such purpose; nothing could escape the watchful
      eyes of those perched on the lofty battlements of this "Sentinel of the
      Merse," no flaming signal from the fords over <span class="pagenum">024</span><a
      name="link024" id="link024"></a>Tweed fail to be seen. In an instant, at
      need, fires would be flashing their messages over all the land, warning
      not only the whole Border, but Dunbar, Haddington, Edinburgh, and even the
      distant shores of life. "A baile is warnyng of ther cumyng quhat power
      whatever thai be of. Twa bailes togedder at anis thai cumyng in deide.
      Four balis, ilk ane besyde uther and all at anys as four candills, sal be
      suthfast knawlege that thai ar of gret power and menys." So ran part of
      the instructions issued in the fifteenth century. But almost in our own
      day&mdash;at least in the days of the grandfathers of some now living&mdash;Home
      Castle flashed its warning and set half Scotland flying to arms. Britain
      then lived under the lively apprehension of a French invasion. With an
      immense army, fully equipped, Napoleon lay at Boulogne waiting a
      favourable opportunity to embark. Little wonder, therefore, that men were
      uneasy in their minds, and that ere they turned in to bed of a night
      country folk cast anxious glances towards some commanding "Law" or Fell,
      where they knew that a beacon lay ready to be fired by those who kept
      watch. In the dull blackness of the night of 31st January, 1804, the
      long-looked-for summons came. All over the Border, on hill after hill
      where of old those dreaded warnings had been wont to flash, a tiny spark
      was seen, then a long tongue of flame leaping skyward. The French were
      coming in earnest at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as ready as it had been in the fiercest days of Border warfare was
      now the response to the sudden call to arms. Over a country almost
      roadless, rural members of the various Yeomanry corps galloped through the
      mirk night, reckless of everything save only that each might reach his
      assembly point in time to fall in with his comrades. Scarce a man failed
      to report himself as ready for service&mdash;in all the Border I believe
      there were but two or three. And though it turned out that the alarm fires
      had been lit through an error of judgment on the part of one of the
      watchers, there is no doubt that to the bulk of the men who turned out so
      full of courage and enthusiasm that night, the <span class="pagenum">025</span><a
      name="link025" id="link025"></a>feeling at first, if mixed with relief,
      was one of disappointment that they had had no chance of trying a fall
      with "Boney" and his veterans. The man who was the first to fire his
      beacon on that 31st of January was a watcher at Home Castle. Peering
      anxiously through the gloom, he imagined that he saw a light flare up in
      the direction of Berwick. It was in reality only a fire lit by
      Northumbrian charcoal-burners that he saw, and its locality was many
      points to the south of Berwick, but as the blaze sprang higher, and the
      flames waxed, the excited watcher lost his head, and, forgetting to verify
      the position, feverishly set a light to his own beacon and sent the
      summons to arms flying over the Border. Had it not chanced that the
      watcher by the beacon on St. Abb's Head was a man of cool temperament, all
      Scotland had been buzzing that night like a hornets' nest. This man,
      however, reasoned with himself that news of an invasion, if it came at
      all, must necessarily come from a coastal, and not from an inland station,
      and therefore he very wisely did not repeat the signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit shown on the occasion of this false alarm, and the promptitude
      with which yeomanry and volunteers turned out, are things of which
      Borderers are justly proud. Many of the yeomanry rode from forty to fifty
      miles that night in order to be in time; and even greater distances were
      covered. Sir Walter Scott himself was in Cumberland when word of the
      firing of the beacons came to him, but within twenty-four hours he and his
      horse had reached Dalkeith, where his regiment was assembled, a distance
      of one hundred miles from his starting point. In one or two instances,
      where members of a corps chanced to be from home, in Edinburgh on private
      business, mother or wife sent off with the troop when it marched, the
      horse, uniform, and arms of husband or son, so that nothing might prevent
      them from joining their regiment at Dalkeith. The substance of the message
      then sent to her son by the widowed mother of the writer's grandfather,
      will be found in Sir Walter's Notes to <i>The Antiquary</i>. If in our day
      <span class="pagenum">026</span><a name="link026" id="link026"></a>like
      cause should unhappily arise, if the dread shadow of invasion should ever
      again fall on our land, no doubt the response would be as eager as it was
      in 1804; the same spirit is there that burned in our forefathers. But of
      what value now-a-days are half-trained men if they come to be pitted
      against the disciplined troops of a Continental Power? Of no more avail
      than that herd of wild bulls that the Spaniards in 1670 tried to drive
      down on Morgan's Buccaneers at Panama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a tale is still told of the events of that stirring night of 31st
      January, 1804. One of the Selkirk volunteers, a man named Chisholm, had
      been married that day; but there was no hesitation on his part. "Weel,
      Peggy, my woman," he said in parting with his day-old bride, "if I'm
      killed, ye'll hear tell o't. And if I'm no killed, I'll come back as sune
      as I can." A particularly "canny" Scot was another volunteer, whose mother
      anxiously demanded ere he marched if he had any money with him in case of
      need. "Na, na!" he said, "they may kill me if they like, but they'll get
      nae siller off <i>me</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few cases of the white feather there were, of course; in so large a body
      of undisciplined men there could hardly fail to be some who had no stomach
      for the fight, but instances of cowardice were surprisingly few. One or
      two there were who hid under beds; and one youth, as he joined the ranks,
      was heard to blubber, "Oh, mother, mother, I wish I'd been born a woman."
      But of those who should have mustered at Kelso, only two out of' five
      hundred failed to answer to their names, and possibly they may have had
      legitimate cause for their absence. Many of the members of foot regiments
      were long distances away when the alarm was given. Of the Duns volunteers,
      for instance, two members were fifteen miles distant when the beacons
      blazed up. Yet they made all speed into the town, got their arms and
      accoutrements, marched all through the night, and fell in alongside their
      comrades at Haddington next forenoon. Many&mdash;all the men of Lessudden,
      for example&mdash;marched without uniforms. An<span class="pagenum">027</span><a
      name="link027" id="link027"></a>unpleasant experience had been theirs had
      they fallen, in civilian dress, into the hands of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to Whitadder.&mdash;Some miles above Broomhouse we come to
      Cockburn Law, a conical hill of about 1100 feet in height, round three
      sides of which the river bends sharply. On the northern slope of the hill
      is the site, and what little remains to be traced, of Edinshall, a
      circular tower dating probably from the seventh century. According to the
      oid Statistical Account of the Parish, the walls of this tower,&mdash;Edwin's
      Hall,&mdash;measured in diameter 85 feet 10 inches, and in thickness 15
      feet 10 inches, enclosing in their depths many cells or chambers. Their
      height must once have been very considerable, for even at date of the
      Statistical Account&mdash;the end of the eighteenth century&mdash;they
      stood about eight feet high, and were surrounded on all sides by a
      scattered mass of fallen stones. The ground around shows traces of having
      been fortified, but the tower itself probably was never a place of
      strength. The stones of which the building was constructed were large, and
      close fitting, but not bound together with mortar, which indeed was not in
      use in Scotland so early as the date of the building of Edinshall,&mdash;hence
      the tower was a quarry too convenient to be respected by agriculturists of
      a hundred years ago. Most of the material of the ancient build ing has
      been taken to construct drains, or to build "dry stane dykes." The "rude
      hand of ignorance" has indeed been heavy on the antiquities of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the stream bends sharply to the left as one fishes up those glorious
      pools and boulder-strewn rapids, there stands a cottage not far removed
      from Edinshall, which on the Ordnance Survey maps bears the very
      un-Scottish name of Elba. It has, however, not even a remote connection
      with the place of exile of an Emperor. The learned would have us believe
      that the name is derived from the Gaelic "Eil," a hill, and "both," a
      dwelling. It may be so; but it seems much more likely that "Elba" is
      merely the Ordnance Survey people's spelling of the <span class="pagenum">028</span><a
      name="link028" id="link028"></a>word "elbow," as it is pronounced in
      Scotland; the river here makes an extremely sharp bend, or elbow. Near
      Elba is an old copper mine which was worked to advantage by an English
      company midway in the eighteenth century. Abandoned after a time, it was
      reopened in 1825, but was soon again closed. Copper was not there in
      sufficient quantity to pay; probably it had been worked out before. Four
      or five miles from here we come to Abbey St. Bathans, a name which
      conjures up visions of peaceful old ruins nestling among whispering elms
      by clear and swift flowing waters. There is now, however, little of
      interest to be found. St. Bathans was originally a convent of Cistercian
      Nuns, with the title of a Priory, and was founded towards the end of the
      twelfth century by Ada, daughter of William the Lion. As late as 1833, the
      then recently written Statistical Account of the Parish says that the
      north and east walls of the church "still bear marks of antiquity," and
      that in the north wall is "an arched door which communicated with the
      residence of the Nuns"; but, says the Account, this door "is now built
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adjoining the church, and between it: and the Whitadder, remains of the
      Priory were visible a few years ago." Where are they now? Built into some
      wall or farm building, no doubt, or broken up, perhaps, to repair roads or
      field drains. And where is the font, with its leaden pipe, that stood "in
      the wall near the altar"? Perhaps&mdash;if it still exists, unbroken,&mdash;it
      may now be used as a trough for feeding pigs, as has been the fate of many
      another such vessel. It is hard to forgive the dull, brutish ignorance
      that wilfully wrecked so much of the beauty and interest that the past
      bequeathed to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not easy to say who was the saint from whom Abbey St. Bathans
      inherited its name. Probably it was Bothan, Prior of Old Mailros in the
      seventh century, a holy man of great fame in the Border. There is a well
      or spring not far distant from the church of St. Bathans, whose miraculous
      powers of healing all sickness or disease were doubtless derived <span
      class="pagenum">029</span><a name="link029" id="link029"></a>from the good
      Father. These powers have now long decayed, but as late as 1833&mdash;possibly
      even later&mdash;some curious beliefs regarding the well were held in the
      neighbourhood, and its waters, it was well known, would "neither fog nor
      freeze" in the coldest weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after leaving Abbey St. Bathans, as we gradually near the
      Lammermuirs, the land on both sides of Whitadder begins more to partake of
      the hill-farm variety, where grouse and blackgame swarm thick on the
      stooked corn in late autumn. From the south side, a little above
      Ellemford, there enters a considerable stream, the water of Dye, said to
      be of good repute as regards its trout. One of these high, round backed
      hills here is probably the scene of some great battle of old times.
      "Manslaughter Law" is the satisfying name of the hill. There is a tumulus
      still remaining on the north side of it, and near at hand weapons have
      been dug up, says the Statistical Account. One wonders what their fate may
      have been. They, at any rate, would surely be preserved? It is by no means
      so sure. One sword, at least, that was found many years ago on the west
      side of Manslaughter Law, met with the fate one might expect from the kind
      of people who used to quarry into beautiful old abbeys in order to get
      material to build a pig-stye. It was taken to the village smithy, and
      there "improved" out of existence&mdash;made into horseshoes perhaps, or a
      "grape for howkin' tatties." Had it been a helmet that was then unearthed,
      no doubt a use would have been found for it such as that which the
      Elizabethan poet sadly suggests for the helmet of the worn out old
      man-at-arms:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "His helmet now shall make a hive for bees."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Eastward from the spot where this sword was found is a barrow which, says
      the Statistical Account, "probably covers more arms"; and on a hill by
      Waich Water, a tributary of the Dye, are the Twin-Law Cairns, which are
      supposed to mark the resting place of twin brothers who fell here,&mdash;perhaps
      in pre-historic <span class="pagenum">030</span><a name="link030"
      id="link030"></a>times. Tradition says that these two were commanders of
      rival armies, Scottish and Saxon, and that, neither at the time being
      aware of their relationship, they undertook to fight it out, as champions
      of the rival hosts. When both lay dead, some old man, who had known the
      brothers in their childhood, gazing on them, with grief discovered the
      relationship of the slain men; and to commemorate the tragedy, the
      soldiers of both hosts formed lines from Waich Water to the hill's summit,
      and passed up stones wherewith they built these cairns.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Byrecleuch Ridge, towards the head of Dye Water, is another enormous
      and very remarkable cairn called the Mutiny Stones. This great mass of
      piled up stone measures two hundred and forty feet in length; where
      broadest, seventy-five feet; and its greatest height is eighteen feet.
      What does it commemorate? A great fight, say some, that took place in 1402
      between the Earl of Dunbar and Hepburn of Hailes, in which the latter was
      killed. A prehistoric place of sepulture, hazards Sir Herbert Maxwell. But
      it was not here that Hepburn fell; that was elsewhere in the Merse. And
      they were little likely in the fifteenth century to have taken such
      titanic pains to hand his memory down to posterity. The prehistoric place
      of sepulture sounds the more probable theory. But why "Mutiny Stones"?
      There must surely be some local tradition more satisfying than that of the
      Hepburn-Dunbar fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper part of Whitadder must once have been well fitted to check
      hostile raids from the south whose object was to strike the fat Lothians
      through the passes over the Lammermuirs. In the few miles of wild hill
      country that sweep from its source on Clint's Dod down to its junction
      with Dye Water, there formerly stood no fewer than six castles, Chambers
      tells us,&mdash;John's Cleuch, Gamelshiel, (the lady of which was killed
      by a wolf as she walked near her home one evening in the gloaming)
      Penshiel, Redpath, Harehead, and Cranshaws. Except in the case of
      Cranshaws, there are now <span class="pagenum">031</span><a name="link031"
      id="link031"></a>few traces left standing of these strongholds. Cranshaws,
      a building of the sixteenth century, is in good preservation; of
      Gamelshiel there remains a bit of wall, of Penshiel a fragment of
      vaulting; of the others no stone. Cranshaws of old, it is said, was long
      the haunt of one of those Brownies, or familiar spirits, that were wont in
      the good old days of our forefathers mysterious ly to do by night, when
      the household slept, all manner of domestic or farm work for those who
      humoured them and treated them well in the matter of food, or other
      indulgence affected by their kind. There was nothing a Brownie would not
      do for the family he favoured, provided that he was kept in good humour;
      otherwise, or if he were laughed at or his work lightly spoken of, it were
      better for that family that it had never been born; their sleep was
      disturbed o' nights, malevolent ill-luck dogged them by day, until he was
      propitiated. But leave out for him each night a jug of milk and a barley
      bannock,&mdash;they were not luxurious in their tastes, those Brownies,&mdash;and
      at dawn you would find

      They tell that this particular Brownie at Cranshaws, being offended at
      some reflection made on his work, the following night took up an entire
      crop that he had thrashed, curried it to the Raven Craig, two miles down
      the river, and threw it over the cliff. Belief in the Brownie died hard in
      the Border I am not sure that in remote "up the water" districts he did
      not survive almost till the advent of motor cars and bicycles.

      the old Statistical Account. Its real name is "Blackwater," according to
      that authority, because it rises out of peaty swamps that impart to its
      waters a look of sullen gloom. I am unable to say what now may be its
      reputation as a trout stream, but long years ago it abounded with "a
      particular species of trout, much larger than the common burn trout, and
      remarkably fat." The Statistical Account mentions a notable peculiarity of
      Blackadder, on the accuracy of which one would be inclined to throw doubt.
      It says that though every other stream in the country which eventually
      mingles its waters with Tweed, swarms with salmon in the season, yet into
      Blackwater they do not go; or if they enter at all, it is found that they
      die before they can ascend many miles. The swampy source of the stream "is
      commonly ascribed as the reason why the fish cannot frequent the river,"
      says the Account. Drainage, one would be inclined to think, has long ago
      removed that fatal nature from the water, if it ever existed. Trout throve
      on it, at all events, red-fleshed beauties, "similar," says the clerical
      <span class="pagenum">033</span><a name="link033" id="link033"></a>writer
      of the Statistical Account of the Parish of Fogo&mdash;a man and a fisher,
      surely&mdash;"to those of Eden Water, which joins Tweed three miles below
      Kelso. The Eden rises also in a marshy district, which may be the cause of
      this similarity of the fish." But most Border streams take their rise in
      more or less marshy districts, though they may not flow direct from a
      swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it in the Eden that Thomson, author of "The Seasons," learned to fish?
      Or was it in Jed? He was born at Ednam,&mdash;Edenham,&mdash;a village on
      the Eden, and he may have loved to revisit it in later years, and to catch
      the lusty speckled trout for which the stream has always been famous.
      Probably, however, he learned to throw a fly on Jed, for he passed his
      boyhood at Southdean&mdash;to which parish his father had been transferred
      as Minister long ere the son was fit to wield a rod&mdash;and he himself
      got his early education at Jedburgh. In Jed or in Eden, then, and perhaps
      in Teviot and Ale&mdash;he was much at Ancrum&mdash;he learned the art;
      and not unskilled in it indeed must he have been. Where in all literature
      can one find a description of trout-fishing so perfect as the following?

      Many a long day of Spring and Summer must the man who could paint so
      perfect a picture have passed, rod in hand and creel on back, by the
      hurrying streams and quiet pools of some Border Water, many a time have
      listened to the summer breeze whispering in the leafy banks, and heard, as
      in a dream, the low murmur of Jed or Ale. And what sport must they have
      had in the old days when Thomson fished&mdash;and even in the days when
      Stoddart fished&mdash;when farmers were ignorant, or careless, of the
      science of drainage, and rivers ran for days, nay, for weeks after rain,
      clear and brown, dimpled with rising trout. What sport indeed of all kinds
      must there have been here in the south of Scotland in very ancient days
      when the country was mostly forest or swamp, and wild animals, now long
      extinct, roamed free over hill and dale. It has been mentioned a page or
      two back how the lady of Gamelshiel Tower was killed by a wolf. Here, at
      the bead waters of Blackadder&mdash;as the crow flies not a dozen miles
      from Gamel<span class="pagenum">035</span><a name="link035" id="link035"></a>shiel&mdash;we
      are in the midst of a district once infested by wolves. Westruther,
      through which parish Blackadder runs, was originally "Wolfstruther," the
      "swamp of the wolves." And all over the surrounding country, place names
      speak of the beasts of the field. An MS. account of Berwickshire tells how
      Westruther was "a place of old which had great woods, with wild beasts,
      fra quhilk the dwellings and hills were designed, as Wolfstruther,
      Raecleuch, Hindside, Hartlaw and Harelaw."

    <p class="indent20">

    </p>
    <p>
      as we read in the "Sang of the Outlaw Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last-mentioned name, Harelaw, calls up visions of another chase than
      that of the hare. Sir Thomas Dick Lauder in his "Scottish Rivers,"
      (written sometime about 1848), mentions that one of the most curious facts
      connected with Harelaw Moor was that a man, who, Sir Thomas says, died
      "not long ago," recollected having seen Sir John Cope and his dragoons in
      full flight across it from the battle of Prestonpans, breathlessly
      demanding from all the country people they met information as to the
      shortest road to Coldstream.

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have been a very aged man, but if "not long ago" meant any time,
      as late, say, as the Twenties of last century, no doubt it would be
      possible that as a boy of eight or ten, he might have seen the
      panic-stricken dragoons spurring over the moor. Such a sight would remain
      vivid in the memory of even a very old man. Childhood's incidents outlive
      all others.

    <p>
      Above Harelaw Moor, on a feeder of the Blackadder, is Wedderlie, formerly
      an old Border keep of the usual pattern, but towards the close of the
      seventeenth century embodied with a fine building in the Scottish style of
      that day. It is <span class="pagenum">036</span><a name="link036"
      id="link036"></a>said to have belonged originally to that family, the
      Edgars, the graves of two members of which are commemorated by the
      Twin-Law Cairns. The family name lives still in that of the neighbouring
      Edgar-burn, near to which streamlet is Gibb's Cross, said to be the scene
      of a martyrdom for sake of the Reformed Faith; and hard by is Evelaw Tower&mdash;a
      house apparently without a history&mdash;still in tolerable preservation.
      At Wedderlie, of old time, says Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, there stood a very
      ancient chapel, of which some traces of a vault remain, or remained at a
      recent date. Local tradition had it that at time of the Reformation the
      monks hid in this vault all their church plate and other precious
      possessions, meaning at the first convenient opportunity to remove them to
      a place of greater safety. The convenient opportunity, it was thought in
      more modern times, had never come, for in a cave hard by the vault there
      was one day discovered a great quantity of coins&mdash;all of which, by
      the way, speedily and mysteriously disappeared. It is said, however, that
      they were not of dates that could in any degree connect this <i>cache</i>
      with the Reformation, and it is suggested in Sir Thomas's book that they
      were concealed there by the inhabitants of Wedderlie during the Religious
      wars of the seventeenth century. Those "in the know" may all have been
      killed, of course; the secret of the hiding place was not likely to be
      within the ken of more than one or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      These finds of coins of all dates are by no means rare in the Scottish
      border counties. One would fain know something of those who hid them, and
      of the events which were passing at the time when they were buried. Were
      they the spoil of some reiver, ravished from a roof-tree blackened and
      left desolate south from Cheviot and Tweed; spoil for convenience sake
      thus put away by one to whom the chance of a more convenient season to
      recover it was ended by a bloody death? Or were they, sometimes, store, of
      coins hastily secreted by quiet country folk fleeing in terror from the
      violence of English <span class="pagenum">037</span><a name="link037"
      id="link037"></a>soldiery&mdash;men such as they who came north with
      Hertford in 1544, whose orders were to put man, woman, and child to fire
      and the sword, without exception, if any resistance should be met with?
      What wonder if the harmless country people then left all, and fled for
      their lives and the honour of their women! For what so easy as to find
      excuse to carry out such orders? A child ill treated, a woman outraged;
      and a man&mdash;husband, father, lover&mdash;mad with horror and impotent
      rage, "resisting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Coins, in greater or less number, are continually turning up in all sorts
      of unlikely spots. Sometimes in a marshy field (where one would least
      expect buried treasure), the spade of an Irish drainer has been known to
      throw out Elizabethan crowns. How did <i>they</i> get there? Perhaps it
      might have been when the horse of some rider, bogged and struggling to get
      clear, in its violent efforts burst the fastenings of a saddle bag or
      wallet, or unseated its rider, emptying whatever may have been the
      equivalent of a trousers' pocket in days when men wore mail. Some of these
      Elizabethan coins, perhaps, found their resting place in 1570, when the
      English under the Earl of Sussex harried and burnt the border, in
      "Tyvydale bernyng on bothe hands at the lest two myle, levyng neyther
      castell, towne, nor tower unbrent, tyll we came to Jedworth." And so on,
      across by Hawick and Branxholm, up by Oxnain Water and Kale and Bowmont,
      and round about Kelso, burning and destroying homes, and hanging
      prisoners. "Thus," says Lord Hunsdon in a letter to Sir W. Cecil, "Thus
      hathe hyr Majesty had as honorable a revenge of the recevars of hyr
      rebels, and of all such as have byn common spoylars of hyr pepoll, and
      burners of her cuntrey, as ever any of hyr predecessors had." They were
      not weakly addicted to half measures in those days, whichever side was
      "top dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so we pray to God to send youre Majestie a longe and prosperowse
      raigne, and all youre enemyes to feare youe as moch as the Scottish
      Borderers feare youe at this present," <span class="pagenum">038</span><a
      name="link038" id="link038"></a>ended Lords Sussex and Hunsdon in a
      despatch written by them to the Queen from "Barwick" on 23rd April, 1570.

    <p>
      The lost Pay-chest of Montrose's army at Philiphaugh has given rise to
      many a story of treasure hunted for or recovered. Sir Walter Scott tells
      how on the day of the battle the Earl of Traquair and one of his
      followers, a blacksmith, carrying with them a large sum of money, the pay
      of the troops, were on their way across the hills to join Montrose at
      Selkirk. When as far away as Minchmuir, they heard the sound of heavy
      firing, to which Lord Traquair attached little importance, believing it to
      be merely Montrose exercising his men, but which, from the long continued
      and irregular nature of the firing, the blacksmith made certain was an
      engagement. By the time they reached Broadmeadows, there was no question
      as to whose conjecture was the correct one. By ones and twos, like the
      first heavy drops, forerunners of a deluge to follow from some ink-black
      cloud, came men flying for their lies, on horses pushed beyond the utmost
      limits of their speed; then more fugitives, and more, and hard on their
      heels, Leslie's troopers thundering. Lord Traquair and the blacksmith
      turned and fled with the throng. But the money was in Lord Traquair's
      saddle-bags, and the weight was great; he was like to be captured, for his
      horse thus handicapped could not face the hill and the heavy ground.
      Whether the blacksmith offered to sacrifice himself to save his master, or
      the master ordered the servant to dismount, one does not know, but the
      outcome was that Lord Traquair fled over the moor on the blacksmith's
      comparatively fresh horse, and the blacksmith, on a spent animal, was left
      to make the best of his way with the silver. Leaving the press of
      fugitives, he fled up Yarrow at the top speed of his tired horse, but
      finding himself closely pursued, to save himself and to lighten the
      animal's load, he flung away the bags of money. He said afterwards that he
      threw them into a well or pond near Tinnis, a little above Hangingshaw,
      and many a well and many a pond has since been vainly dragged for the lost
      treasure. No man <span class="pagenum">039</span><a name="link039"
      id="link039"></a>has yet recovered it. Probably that blacksmith knew a
      thing or two, and he was not likely to give away the show. Whether or no,
      however, it is certain that many silver coins having dates of about the
      time of the battle were in Sir Walter's day ploughed up on the river
      haughs of Tinnis. And at a much later date, a quantity of coins and some
      silver plate were unearthed nearer Philiphaugh, on the actual scene of the
      fight. These coins were claimed by the Exchequer. A dozen wine bottles,
      also, of old pattern, were found buried here, but what had been the liquor
      contained in them it was not possible to say; the bouquet had entirely
      perished, and even the colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a pool in Yarrow, near Harehead, into which tradition says that
      Montrose flung his treasure chest, telling the Devil to keep it till he
      should return to claim it. Up to the present the Foul Fiend has not
      released his care, for when&mdash;as is said,&mdash;the pool was run dry,
      or nearly dry, a good many years ago, only a Lochabar-axe was found in it.
      A somewhat more probable story of the chest is that the bearer, as he
      hurried past, flung it into a cottage, near Foulshiels, and then rode for
      his life. Some of Leslie's men got it there, and looted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose is the portrait that is contained in the little locket which was
      found, years ago, on the field of Philiphaugh? On the one side is the
      representation of a heart pierced by darts, and the motto "I dye for
      Loyalty"; on the other, a long straight sword is engraved. Inside is a
      portrait, and opposite the portrait, the words "I mourne for Monarchie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes coins have been found, too, as at Blackcastle Rings, on
      Blackadder, at its junction with the Faungrist Burn. Here, on the northern
      bank of the river, is what must once have been a strongly fortified camp;
      opposite, on the southern side, and running along the river's bank for
      fully half a mile, after which it branches to the south, is a well marked
      line of entrenchment. Eighty years ago, or thereabouts, an old silver
      chain was unearthed in the camp; and in the <span class="pagenum">040</span><a
      name="link040" id="link040"></a>trench, a little distance away, when turf
      was being removed, they came upon quite a number of gold and silver coins
      of the reign of Edward III. It was somewhere in this neighbourhood,
      (though probably nearer Duns,) that Lord Percy the English Warden, at the
      head of seven thousand men, lay encamped in the year 1372, when (as is
      mentioned by Redpath), his host was dispersed, or at least was said to
      have been compelled to retire across the Tweed, on foot and without their
      baggage, owing to a simple stratagem of the Scots. To scare away from
      their poor little crops the deer and wild cattle that were wont when night
      fell to ravage the ill-cultivated patches, the country folk of that
      district were accustomed to sound at frequent intervals a primitive kind
      of drum. To the ends of long poles were fixed what may best be termed huge
      rattles, made of dried skins tightly stretched over semi-circular ribs of
      wood. Inside each skin were put a few round pebbles. Obviously, when
      shaken vigorously, these rattles would give out a noise quite terrifying
      to any four footed animal, especially when heard in the stillness of
      night. Accordingly, one pitchy night, in the hour before dawn when sleep
      lay heavy on the invading force, a certain number of the Scots, bearing
      with them those unwarlike instruments, stole quietly through the tangled
      growth to the heights on either side of the English camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then broke out a din truly infernal. Picketed horses, mad with terror,
      strained back on their head-ropes, and breaking loose, stampeded through
      the camp, trampling over the recumbent forms of men wearied and even yet
      but halt-awake, many of the younger among them more than ready to share
      the panic of their horses. If the tale be not exaggerated, daylight showed
      an army deprived of its transport animals, its horsemen compelled to foot
      it, their steeds the prey of the wily Scots; a baggageless force compelled
      to fall back in disorder across Tweed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this part of Berwickshire you may still faintly trace here and there
      the outline of a ditch and earthen rampart called <span class="pagenum">041</span><a
      name="link041" id="link041"></a>Herrits Dyke, which, local tradition says,
      once ran from Berwick inland to near Legerwood on Leader Water,&mdash;a
      work not dis-similar to the Catrail, (which cuts across something like
      fifty miles of the Border, from Peel Fell in the Cheviots to Torwoodlee on
      Gala), but without the double wall of Catrail. There are various sections
      of defensive works of this nature in the Border&mdash;if they were
      defensive, for instance, on the hill less than half a mile from the old
      castle of Holydean, near St. Boswells, in Roxburghshire, there is a
      particularly well-marked ditch and double rampart running for some
      distance across the moor. It can scarcely be a continuation of Herrits
      Dyke, for its construction is different, and its course must run almost at
      a right angle to Herrits, which is, indeed, many miles away from Holydean.
      This ditch points almost directly towards Torwoodlee, but it is out of the
      accepted Catrail track, unless the latter, instead of stopping at
      Torwoodlee, (as one has been taught), turned sharply and swept down the
      vale-of Gala, and once more crossed Tweed. It is curious, if these works
      are defensive, that no ancient weapons have ever been found in or near
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the water a few miles from Blackcastle Rings stands the little town
      of Greenlaw, a settlement which dates from very early times, but not on
      its present site. Originally the village stood about a mile and a half to
      the south east, on the isolated green "law" or hill from which it takes
      its name. The history of the present town goes no farther back than the
      end of the seventeenth century, a date about contemporaneous with that of
      its Market Cross, which stands now on the west side of the place. This
      cross is said to have been erected by Sir Patrick Home of Polwarth
      (afterwards created Earl of March-mont) in the year 1696. In 1829 it was
      pulled down, to make room for something else&mdash;in the maddening
      fashion that possessed our ancestors of the period&mdash;and, in the usual
      manner, it was chucked aside as "auld world trash." In 1881, however, the
      cross, or at least the greater part of it, minus the top, which <span
      class="pagenum">042</span><a name="link042" id="link042"></a>originally
      bore a lion rampant, was discovered in the basement of the old church
      tower, and was then re-erected where it now stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still farther down the river is the Roman camp at Chesters. But even as
      long ago as 1798, the writer of the Statistical Account of the Parish of
      Fogo complained that the old camp was "very much defaced," and that the
      stones had mostly been "removed to make room for the plough." The rage for
      agricultural improvement was in 1798 but in extreme infancy; and as no
      Society for the preservation of ancient monuments came into existence for
      many a long year afterwards, and interest in such things was confined to
      the very few, it is safe to infer that not a great deal of this camp now
      exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Chesters to Marchmont is but a step. Marchmont House dates from about
      1754, and was built by the third Earl of Marchmont, near the site of
      Redbraes, the residence of his grandfather, that Sir Patrick Home of
      Polwarth who erected the cross in Greenlaw. The village and church of
      Polwarth are at no great distance. The original church was consecrated in
      the tenth century, and was restored in 1378, from which date it stood till
      1703, when Sir Patrick Home (then Earl of Marchmont) rebuilt it. In the
      family vault of this church, Sir Patrick lay in hiding for several weeks
      in 1684, when the search for him was hot and discovery would have cost him
      his head. The secret of his whereabouts was known to three persons&mdash;to
      his wife, his daughter Grisell (whose name as Lady Grisell Baillie, lives
      still in the affectionate remembrance of the Scottish Border), and to
      Jamie Winter, a faithful retainer. Grisell Home, then a girl of eighteen,
      during all the time of his concealment contrived, with very great risk and
      difficulty, to convey food to her father in his gruesome lodging. Each
      night, she slipped stealthily from the house, and&mdash;sorest trial of
      all to the nerves of an imaginative Scot,&mdash;made her cautious way in
      the darkness across the "bogle"-haunted churchyard to her father's lair.
      Many a shift were she and her <span class="pagenum">043</span><a
      name="link043" id="link043"></a>mother put to in order to get food
      sufficient for their prisoner without rousing suspicion among the
      servants, and more than once the situation was all but given away by the
      innocent hut embarrassing comments of young and irresponsible members of
      the family. Sometimes the servants cannot have been present at meals, one
      would think; or else they smelt a rat, and were discreetly blind. One day
      at dinner, Grisell had with careful cunning succeeded in smuggling an
      entire sheep's head off the dish on to her own lap, thence presently to be
      borne surreptitiously from the room, when her young brother, with the
      maddening candour and persistency of childhood, called the company's
      attention to his sister's prodigious appetite, which not only enabled her
      to gobble up in next to no time so much good meat, but even rendered her
      able to make the very bones vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the scent at length began to grow hot; they had nearly run the fox to
      his earth. Suspicion hovered over the neighbourhood of the church, and no
      longer could the vault be deemed even a moderately safe hiding place. A
      new den was necessary; and a new den was found, one perhaps even more
      cramped than the old quarters, if a trifle less insanitary. A large deal
      box was made by the faithful Jamie Winter, and was secretly conveyed into
      a cellar at Redbraes, of which Lady Home kept the key. But to get the
      "muckle kist" snugly into its resting place, it was necessary to scrape
      away the earthen floor of the cellar under the flooring hoards, so that
      the box might be entirely hidden when the boards were re-laid. This work
      could not be done with pick and shovel, lest the noise should betray what
      was going on. Grisell, therefore, and Jamie Winter literally with their
      own hands carried out the arduous job; the earth was <i>scraped</i> away,
      and poor Grisell Home's nails had almost entirely disappeared ere the work
      wyas finished and the hiding place made ready for her father. It was
      scarcely an ideal place of concealment; water oozed in so quickly that one
      night when Sir Patrick was about <span class="pagenum">044</span><a
      name="link044" id="link044"></a>to descend into his narrow lodging, it was
      found that the bedding on which he was used to lie was afloat. And, with
      its other drawbacks, it had not even the advantage, as a hiding place, of
      being above suspicion. Had it not been, indeed, for the presence of mind
      of a kinsman and namesake, Home of Halyburton, a party of dragoons had
      certainly captured Sir Patrick one day. But Halyburton's liquor was good,
      and after their thirty mile march from Edinburgh, the temptation to wet
      their whistle could not be resisted. It did not take long, but it was long
      enough; a groom on a fast, powerful horse slipped away over the moor to
      Redbraes, bearing with him no word of writing, but a letter addressed to
      Lady Home, of which the contents were nothing but a feather,&mdash;a hint
      sufficiently well understood. Ere the dragoons arrived at Redbraes, Sir
      Patrick was clear away and well on the road to the coast and Holland, and
      safety.

      As we travel down Blackadder towards its junction with the Whitadder,
      about equidistant between the two rivers we come to the only town of any
      importance in the district&mdash;Duns, or Dunse as it used, not very
      appropriately, to be spelled from 1740 to 1882, in which latter year the
      ancient spelling was revived. The original hamlet or settlement stood on
      the Dun or Law which adjoins the present town. But Hertford wiped that
      pretty well out of existence in 1545, as he wiped out many another
      stronghold and township in the south of Scotland. What was left of the
      place soon fell into utter decay and ruin, and a new settlement on the
      present site, then guarded On three sides by a more or less impassable
      swamp, sprung up in 1588. Duns is one of several places which claim the
      honour of having been the birthplace of the learned Duns Scotus
      (1265-1338), but even though she be unable quite to substantiate this
      claim, her record of worthy sons is no short one. And was not that woman,
      famed in the seventeenth century, she who was possessed of an evil spirit
      which caused her, an illiterate person, to talk fluently in the Latin
      tongue, a <span class="pagenum">045</span><a name="link045" id="link045"></a>native
      of Duns! The Privy Council Record, under date 13th July, 1630, contains an
      order for bringing before it Margaret Lumsden, "the possessed woman in
      Duns," along with her father-in-law and her brother, that order might be
      taken in the case, "as the importance and nature of such a great cause
      requires." A fast for her benefit was even proposed by sundry clergymen;
      interest in her case was acute and widespread. Twenty-nine years later, an
      account of the circumstances was written by the Earl of Lauderdale, and
      was published in Baxter's "Certainty of the World of Spirits." Lord
      Lauderdale was a schoolboy in 1630, but he was accustomed to hear the case
      very fully discussed by his father and the minister of Duns, the latter of
      whom, at least, firmly believed that the woman was possessed by an evil
      spirit. The Earl wrote as follows to Baxter: "I will not trouble you with
      many circumstances; one only I shall tell you, which I think will evince a
      real possession. The report being spread in the country, a knight of the
      name of Forbes, who lived in the north of Scotland, being come to
      Edinburgh, meeting there with a minister of the north, and both of them
      desirous to see the woman, the northern minister invited the knight to my
      father's house (which was within ten or twelve miles of the woman),
      whither they came, and next morning went to see the woman. They found her
      a poor ignorant creature, and seeing nothing extraordinary, the minister
      says in Latin to the knight: '<i>Nondum audivimus spiritum loquentem</i>.'
      Presently a voice comes out of the woman's mouth: '<i>Andis loquentem,
      audis loquentem</i>.' This put the minister into some amazement (which I
      think made him not mind his own Latin); he took off his hat, and said: '<i>Misereatur
      Deus peccatoris!</i>' The voice presently out of the woman's mouth said: '<i>Dic
      peccatricis, dic peccatricis</i>'; whereupon both of them came out of the
      house fully satisfied, took horse immediately, and returned to my father's
      house at Thirlestane Castle, in Lauderdale, where they related this
      passage. This I do exactly remember. Many more particulars <span
      class="pagenum">046</span><a name="link046" id="link046"></a>might be got
      in that part of the country; but this Latin criticism, in a most
      illiterate ignorant woman, where there was no pretence to dispossessing,
      is enough, I think." It was, of course, an infallible sign of demoniac
      possession that the victim, mostly an illiterate person, should break out
      into Latin or Greek, Hebrew or what not. That was how the devil usually
      betrayed himself; he could by no means control his weakness for talking&mdash;generally
      very badly&mdash;in foreign tongues.

      The wonders of Duns in the seventeenth century by no means ceased,
      however, with this demon-possessed Margaret Lumsden. In 1639, when Leslie
      camped on Duns Law with the Covenanting army and its superfluity of
      ministers, there occurred a remarkable land-slide which the excited
      imaginations of those witnessing its effects could not fail to interpret
      as an assured sign that Providence meant to fight on their side. A bank on
      the slope of the hill near to the camp slid down,&mdash;it had probably
      become water-logged as the result of heavy rain.&mdash;disclosing
      "innumerable stones, round, for the most part, in shape, and perfectly
      spherical,... like ball of all sizes, from a pistol to fixed pieces, such
      as sakers or robenets, or battering pieces upwards." Men looked on them
      with awe, and bore <span class="pagenum">047</span><a name="link047"
      id="link047"></a>about with them specimens in their pockets, gravely
      showing them to excited throngs. "Nor wanted there a few who interpreted
      this stone magazine at Duns Hill as a miracle, as if God had sent this by
      ane hid providence for the use of the Covenanters."

      We return now to Tweed, where on a steep slope stand the mighty ruins of
      Norham Castle, guarding the ford; we all know the scene, castle and ford
      in the gloaming, from Turner's beautiful plate in <i>Liber Studiorum</i>.
      Bishop Flambard of Durham built the castle to bridle the wild Scots, in
      1121; some twenty years later it was taken, under David; but the eastern
      side shows the remains of the warlike prelate's work. "The <span
      class="pagenum">048</span><a name="link048" id="link048"></a>Norman Keep
      still frowns across the Merse," and few of the castles of the age of
      chivalry display more of their ancient strength than Norham. Yet it
      yielded promptly to James IV. in the first week of the campaign which
      closed in the terrible defeat of Flodden Edge. In this castle, in the Lent
      of 1200, William the Lion kept his fast on fourteen kinds of fish,
      including salmon; he certainly "spelled his fasts with an e." While
      Berwick yielded to the Scots in the dark days of Edward II., good Sir
      Thomas de Grey, of that ancient Northumbrian house, held Norham stoutly,
      with pretty circumstances of chivalry, as his son tells in <i>Scalacronica</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over against Norham is Ladykirk, with its ancient church, dedicated,
      tradition says, by James IV. to the Virgin Mary, in gratitude for his
      narrow escape from death here when fording the swollen Tweed. A field to
      the east of the village shows some, remains of military works, ramparts
      for guns probably, from which to fire on Norham. In a line between this
      spot and the castle there was found in the river a stone cannon-ball,
      fifty-seven inches in girth, probably one fired from "Mons Meg" when she
      was here in 1497.

      Following the light bank of Tweed we reach Carham burn, where Malcolm II.
      won Lothian in battle; from Carham to the sea the right bank is English.
      The next important tributary on the English side, as we ascend the stream
      is Till, formed by Bowmont and Breamish Waters, which rise in the
      "Cheeviots," as the Scots pronounce the name.

      On August 22nd, James IV., "a fey man," kept his plighted word to France,
      which Henry VIII. was invading, and led the whole force of Highlands and
      Lowlands across the Border. He made his quarters at Ford Castle, where he
      did not, as legend says, dally with Lady Heron, still less did his young
      son, the Archbishop of St. Andrews, fleet the time carelessly with her
      daughter. <span class="pagenum">050</span><a name="link050" id="link050"></a>James

      Surrey with the English levies, including the Stanleys, sent a challenge
      from Alnwick. On September 3rd, the Scots are said to have wrecked Ford
      Castle, now a substantial and comfortable home, still containing the
      king's rooms. James crossed the Till by a bridge at Ford, as the tourist
      also does, if he wishes to see the field of the famous battle. We climb to

      They pitched their camp on the wide level of Wooler haugh, six miles to
      the right of Flodden; and on this plain Surrey challenged James to meet
      him, "a fair field and no favour." For once chivalry gave place to common
      sense in James's mind: "he would take and keep his ground at his own
      pleasure." But he neglected his scouting, though he had hundreds of Border
      riders under Home, who should never have lost touch of Surrey. That wily
      "auld decrepit carl in a chariot" as Pitscottie calls him, disappeared;
      James probably thought that he was retiring to Berwick. Really, he was
      throwing himself, unseen, on James's line of communication with the north:
      he camped at Barmoor wood, and then recrossed Till by Twizel bridge.
      Scott, in <i>Marmion</i> and elsewhere, blames the king for failing to see
      this manouvre and discuss Surrey before his men could deploy after
      crossing by Twizel bridge and at Millford. But Twizel bridge you cannot
      see from Flodden Edge; Sir Walter had forgotten the lie of the ground.
      Unseen, the English crossed and formed, advancing from the north towards
      the second of the three great steps in the declivity, called Branxton
      hill. In the early evening, <i>Angli se ostentant</i>, the English come
      into view. In <span class="pagenum">052</span><a name="link052"
      id="link052"></a>place of holding his ground, which he is said to have
      entrenched, James yielded to his impetuous temper, fired his camp, and his
      men throwing off their boots, for the ground was wet and slippery, rushed
      down to the Branxton plateau.

      "The haggis, Cott pless her, could charge down a hill," like Dundee's men
      at Killiecrankie, but the expected impetus must have been lost before
      James's Highlanders under Lennox and Argyll, his right wing, could come to
      sword-strokes. James's right, in addition to the clans, had a force led by
      d'Aussi and Both well, with whom may have been the ancestors of John Knox,
      as the Reformer told the wild Earl, Queen Mary's lover. The main body, the
      centre, under the flower of Scottish <i>noblesse</i>, were with the king;
      who "always fought before he had given his orders," says Ayala, the
      ambassador of Spain. His left was led by Crawford and Errol; his extreme
      left by Huntly with the gay Gordons; and Home with his Border spears,

      The Admiral sent a galloper to bring Surrey forward; and Home and Huntly
      charged Edward Howard, while Dacre's Tyneside men ran, as he advanced to
      support Howard. The Borderers, fond of raiding each other, could never be
      trusted to fight each other in serious war; they were much intermarried.
      Brian Tunstal fell, Dacre stopped Huntly; Home's men vanished like ghosts,
      no man knew whither; for they appeared on the field next morning. Probably
      they were plundering, but "Down wi' the Earl o' Home," says the old song
      of the Souters of Selkirk. In the centre of the vanguard the Admiral and
      the Percys clashed with Crawford and Errol. Both leaders fell, and James
      threw the weight of his centre against Surrey. To slay that general with
      his own hand was the king's idea of the duty of a leader. But the English
      guns <span class="pagenum">054</span><a name="link054" id="link054"></a>mowed
      down his ranks, and the Scots could not work their French artillery. The
      king pressed in with Herries and Maxwell at his side; the ranks of England
      reeled, but the Admiral and Dacre charged James's men in flank. "Stanley
      broke Lennox and Argyll" on the king's right; the noble leaders fell, and
      the nimble Highlanders rapidly made a strategic movement in the direction
      of safety. Stanley did not pursue them, but fell on James's right, which
      now had the enemy on each flank and in front.

      The king was not content to remain within the hedge of spears. Running out
      in advance, he fought his way to "within a lance's length" of Surrey, so
      Surrey wrote; his body was pierced with arrows, his left arm was half
      severed by a bill-stroke, his neck was gashed, and he fell. James was not
      a king to let his followers turn his bridle-rein; he fought on foot, like
      a Paladin, and died with honour. His nobles advanced; the spears defended
      the dead, and the bodies of thirteen of his peers and of two Bishops who,
      like Archbishop Turpin at Roncesvaux, died in harness, lay round him. An

      As matter of plain history, this honourable defeat was to my country what,

      France. It was too late in literary times for an epic like the <i>Chanson

      by lines of English archers, and left heaps as high as a lance's length,

      withdrew southwards. I visited Flodden Edge on my return from the west of
      Ireland, where I found the living belief in Fairies. I picked up a trifle
      of the faith at Flodden. The guide, a most intelligent elderly man, named
      Reidpath, told me this yarn: "A woman came to my brother," (I knew that he
      meant a woman of the Faery), "and told him to dig in such a place. He
      would find a stone, below it a stone pillar; and another stone, and
      beneath it a treasure. My brother and my father dug, found the stone, and
      the pillar, and the stone below&mdash;but no treasure!" Probably you will

      notes of my grandfather, it was not quite dead in his day.

      Here we leave Till to those who choose to fish it up towards the Cheviots,

    <p>
      Before reaching that point, however, there are one or two places to notice
      on both sides of the river&mdash;Coldstream, for <span class="pagenum">057</span><a
      name="link057" id="link057"></a>example, where Leet water enters Tweed;

    <p>
      Regarding the Leet, in order to find oneself filled with envy and with
      longing unutterable, it is only necessary to read Stoddart's account of
      the fishing to be had in his day in that curious little stream. "Of all
      streams that I am acquainted with," says Stoddart, "the Leet, which
      discharges itself into the Tweed above Coldstream, was wont, considering
      its size, to contain the largest trout. During the summer season it is a
      mere ditch, in many places not above four or five span in width, and,
      where broadest, still capable of being leapt across. The run of water is,
      comparatively speaking, insignificant, not exceeding on the average a
      cubic foot. This, however, as it proceeds, is every now and then expanded
      over a considerable surface, and forms a pool of some depth; in fact, the
      whole stream, from head to foot, pursuing, as it does, a winding course
      for upwards of twelve miles, is a continued chain of <span class="pagenum">058</span><a
      name="link058" id="link058"></a>pools, fringed, during the summer, on both
      sides, with rushes and water-flags, and choked up in many parts with
      pickerel weed and other aquatic plants. The channel of Leet contains shell
      marl, and its banks, being hollowed out beneath, afford, independent of
      occasional vines and tree roots, excellent shelter for trout. Not many
      years ago the whole course of it was infested with pike, but the visit of
      some otters, irrespective of the angler's art, has completely cleared them
      out, and thus allowed the trout, which were formerly scarce, to become
      more numerous. On the first occasion of my fishing Leet, which happened to
      be early in April 1841, before the sedge and rushes had assumed the
      ascendency, I captured, with the fly, twenty-six trout, weighing in all
      upwards of twenty-nine pounds. Of these, five at least were two-pounders,
      and there were few, if any, small-sized fish." On another occasion, in
      June 1846, Stoddart caught in the same water, in four hours, three dozen
      and five fish, the biggest of which weighed 3 lbs., and a dozen of the
      others 1 lb. apiece. This stream, in its characteristics so unlike the
      usual Scottish burn, is not open to the public, but it may be assumed that
      no such fishing is now obtainable there, any more than it is to be got
      elsewhere in Scotland. Once they establish themselves and make unchecked
      headway, pike are very hard to extirpate; it is not in every stream that
      one finds otters so accommodating, and so careful of the interests of
      anglers, as they appear to have been in Leet in Stoddart's day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coldstream, where Leet joins Tweed, was of old chiefly known for its ford,
      the first of any consequence above Berwick. It was here that the invading
      army of Edward the First crossed the river into Scotland in 1296; here,
      indeed, it was that most armies, English or Scottish, plunged into country
      hostile to them once they had quitted their own bank of the river; it was
      here that all Scottish travellers, from royalty to peasant, must halt when
      southward bound, and await the falling of the waters should Tweed chance
      to be in flood. Consequently, at <span class="pagenum">059</span><a
      name="link059" id="link059"></a>a very early date a settlement sprang up,
      and in it many an historical personage has temporarily sojourned. Sir
      Thomas Dick Lauder says that as late as his own day an old thatched two
      storied building in the village was pointed out as the house in which
      "many persons of distinction, including kings and queens of Scotland, are
      enumerated by tradition as having resided.... occasionally several days at
      a time," waiting till the river was fordable. It was not till 1766, when
      Smeaton completed his fine bridge, that any other crossing of the stream
      than by the ford was possible. In pre-Reformation times, there was in
      Coldstream a rich Priory of Cistercian Nuns, not a stone of which,
      however, now remains. But in its little burial ground, between the river
      and what used to be the garden of the Priory, in 1834 there was dug up a
      great quantity of human bones, and a stone coffin. The bones were supposed
      to be probably those of various Scottish persons of rank who fell but a
      short five or six miles away on the fatal field of Flodden. Tradition
      tells that the Abbess of that day, anxious to give Christian burial to her
      slain countrymen, caused the bodies of many Scots of rank and birth to be
      borne from the field of battle to the Priory, and there laid them to rest
      in consecrated ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till about 1865 there stood in the village another interesting old house,
      and on the building which now occupies its site may be read the following
      inscription: "Headquarters of the Coldstream Guards, 1659; rebuilt, 1865."
      Here it was that General Monk formed that famous regiment, than which
      there is but one in the British army whose history goes further back, none
      which in achievements can surpass it. In one of his works on England at
      the period of the Restoration of Charles the Second, M. Guizot, the French
      historian, records that Monk "spent about three weeks at Coldstream, which
      was a favourable spot for the purpose, as the Tweed was there fordable;
      but he seems to have found it a dismal place to quarter in. On his first
      arrival, he could get no provisions for his own <span class="pagenum">060</span><a
      name="link060" id="link060"></a>dinner, and was obliged to content himself
      with a quid of tobacco. His chaplains, less easily satisfied, roamed about
      till they obtained a meal at the house of the Earl of Home, near by." This
      place, to which the fine instinct of those preachers guided them, was no
      doubt The Hirsel, which is at no great distance from Coldstream.

      There is yet another thing for which this little town was famed in former
      days. In the time of our grandsires, and indeed, down to as late a date as
      1856, when clandestine weddings were prohibited by Act of Parliament, it
      was a common sight to see a post-chaise come racing over Coldstream
      Bridge, or, in days before a bridge existed, splashing through the water
      from the English side, bearing in it some fond couple (like Mr. Alfred
      Jingle and the Spinster Aunt), flying on love's wings from stony-hearted
      parent or guardian. Coldstream was almost as famous a place for run-away
      marriages as was Gretna Green itself. At the former place, the ceremony
      was usually performed in the toll-house at the Scottish end of the bridge,
      where "priests" were always in readiness to tie up the run-away <span
      class="pagenum">061</span><a name="link061" id="link061"></a>couples, and
      to issue to them thereafter a Certificate of Marriage, such as the
      following, which is a copy of one issued in 1836: "This is to certify that
      John Chambers, Husbandman, from the Broomhouse, in the Parish of Chatton,
      with Mary Walker from Kelso, in the Parish of Kelso, in Roxboroughshire,
      was married by me this Day. As witness to my hand, William Alexander,
      Coldstream, 15th Dec., 1836. Witnesses' names: Miss Dalgleish, Miss
      Archer."
    </p>
    <p>
      But though for convenience' sake, and probably for speed of dispatch, the
      toll-house was chiefly patronised, those who had command of money and were
      not unduly pressed for time could arrange to have their nuptials
      celebrated in less public fashion than would probably be the case at the
      bridge-end. It is I believe an undoubted fact that in 1819 Lord Brougham
      was married in the chief inn of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those irregular marriages were in the eighteenth century a great source of
      trouble and annoyance to the Kirk Session of Kelso. A good many of them at
      one time were celebrated by a certain Mr. Blair, whom the Privy Council
      had ejected from the incumbency of Coldstream in 1689 because he had
      refused to pray for the King and Queen, (William and Mary), and would
      neither read the proclamation of the Estates nor observe the national
      thanksgiving. Mr. Blair, however, after the loss of his incumbency
      continued to live in the village, and, it was alleged, was, in the matter
      of these marriages sometimes over accommodating and good-natured regarding
      dates; in his certificates he did not always rigidly adhere to the true
      day of month or year in cases where it might be represented to him that a
      fictitious date would be less compromising to the contracting parties. Mr.
      Blair was "sharply rebukit" by the Session. The reverend gentleman was not
      in Coldstream later than 1728, and he died at Preston, in Northumberland,
      in 1736, <span class="pagenum">062</span><a name="link062" id="link062"></a>at
      the age of eighty-five. The following is the epitaph composed on him:

      In examining Scottish Border records of those times, nothing strikes one
      more than the power of the Kirk Sessions; it is indeed hard to imagine a
      country more priest ridden than Scotland in the eighteenth century. The
      "Sabbath" was then as easy to break as a hedge-sparrow's egg, and there
      were a thousand&mdash;to modern eyes not very heinous&mdash;ways of
      breaking it. What in the way of punishment may have been meted out to the
      unfortunate who fell asleep under the infliction of a long, dull, prosy
      sermon in a stuffy, ill-ventilated church on a warm summer's day, one
      hardly cares to conjecture, so rigidly enforced was the duty of listening
      to sermons; whilst to be abroad "in time of sermon" was sin so heinous
      that Elders were, so to speak, specially retained to prowl around and nose
      out offenders. Walking on the Sabbath day&mdash;"vaguing," they called it,&mdash;was
      looked on with horror, and called for stern reprimand. In 1710, it was
      observed that sundry persons in Kelso were "guiltie of profaning the
      Sabbath by walking abroad in the fields after sermons," and the Session
      called on the parish minister to "give them a general reproof out of the
      pulpit the next Loird's Day, and to dehort them from so doing in time
      coming, with certification that the Session will take strict notice of any
      one guiltie of it." For less than "vaguing," however, a man might be
      brought before the Session. In 1710, Alexander Graemslaw of Maxwellheugh
      was "dilated for bringing in cabbage to his house the last Lord's Day
      between sermons," <span class="pagenum">063</span><a name="link063"
      id="link063"></a>and was "cited to the next Session." ("Dilate" is
      probably less painful than it sounds). He was only "rebuked" about the
      cabbages: but then they fell on him and demanded an explanation of his not
      having been at church. Altogether they made things unpleasantly warm for
      Alexander. In 1708, Alexander Handiside and his son, and a woman named
      Jean Ker were had up for "walking to and fro on the Sabbath." At first
      they "compeared not" on being cited, but on a second citation Handiside
      "compeared," and vainly advanced the plea that his walking to and fro was
      occasioned by the fact that he had been attending a child who had broken a
      leg or an arm. He "was exhorted to be a better observer of the Sabbath." A
      Scot, apparently, might not upon the Scottish Sabbath draw from a pit his
      ox or his ass which had fallen in. This same year, "those who searched the
      town" discovered two small boys "playing on the Sabbath day in time of
      sermon." The Session dealt sternly with the hardened ruffians. Amongst
      other cases that one reads of there is that of Katherine Thomson. One's
      sympathies rather go with Katherine, who when reproved by a sleuth-hound
      Elder for "sitting idly at her door in time of sermon," abused her
      reprover. But the Session made it warm for a woman who thus not only, as
      they said, "profaned the Sabbath," but was guilty of "indescreet carriage
      to the Elder." One trembles to think how easy it was to slip into sin in
      those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But over and above this Juggernaut power of the Session, there was another
      weapon much used by eighteenth century ministers, whereby they kept a
      heavy hand on the bowed backs of their congregations. It was their habit,
      where the conduct, real or fancied, of any member of their flock offended
      them, to speak <i>at</i> the culprit during service on Sundays, and to
      speak at him in no uncertain voice. The practice is probably now dead,
      even in remote country parishes, but fifty years ago it was still a
      favourite weapon in the hands of old-fashioned ministers, and in the
      eighteenth century it seems to have been in almost <span class="pagenum">064</span><a
      name="link064" id="link064"></a>universal use. The Reverend Mr. Ramsay,
      minister of Kelso from 1707 till his death in 1749, was a dexterous and
      unsparing wielder of this ecclesiastical flail. It chanced once that there
      "sat under" him&mdash;as we say in Scotland&mdash;a Highlander, a man who
      had deserted from the ranks of the rebel army in the '15, and had
      afterwards managed to get appointed to a post in the Excise at Kelso. This
      man's seat in church was in the front pew of the gallery, immediately
      facing Mr. Ramsay, and his every movement, therefore, was likely to catch
      the minister's eye. Now, the exciseman had a habit which greatly annoyed
      Mr. Ramsay. As soon as the sermon commenced, the Highlander produced a
      pencil, with which he proceeded to make marks on a slip of paper. He may,
      perhaps, have been making calculations not unconnected with his duties as
      exciseman,&mdash;a scandalous proceeding when he should have been all ears
      for the Word as expounded by the minister; or, again, on the other hand he
      may really have been devoutly attentive to the sermon, and engaged in
      making notes on it,&mdash;a thing perhaps not over and above likely in an
      ex-Highland rebel. In any case he annoyed Mr. Ramsay, and one day the
      irritation became acute. Pausing in his discourse in order to give
      emphasis to his words, and looking straight at the exciseman, he cried:
      "My brethren, I tell ye, except ye be born again, it is as impossible for
      you to enter the Kingdom of Heaven as it is for a Hielander no to be a
      thief! Man wi' the keel-o-vine," he thundered, "do ye hear <i>that?</i>"
      (For the benefit of non-Scottish readers it may be necessary to explain
      that a "keel-o-vine" is a pencil).

    <p>
      A few miles above Coldstream, after a course of about four and twenty
      miles, the beautiful little Eden Water joins Tweed. Its capabilities as a
      trout stream are spoken of elsewhere in this volume, and the little river
      is now mentioned only to record a tragedy of unusual nature which occurred
      in it in the earlier half of the nineteenth century. Two young ladies,
      sisters of the then proprietor of Newton Don, a beautiful estate on the
      right bank of Eden, had come from Edinburgh to <span class="pagenum">065</span><a
      name="link065" id="link065"></a>pass the summer and autumn at their
      brother's house. With them was a friend, a Miss Ramsay. It chanced that
      one afternoon these three young ladies were walking along the banks of the
      river, on the side opposite to Newton Don. They had strolled farther than
      at starting had been their intention, and time had slipped past unnoticed,
      and while they still had some distance to go on their return way, they
      were surprised by the sound of the house bell ringing for dinner. Now, a
      little below the spot where they then were, it was possible to cross the
      river by stepping stones, an easy, and to every appearance a perfectly
      safe way by which anybody beyond the age of childhood might gain the other
      side, without much risk even of wetting a shoe. The three girls,
      accordingly, started to go over by these stones. The water was low and
      clear, the weather fine; there had been no thunderstorm that might have
      been capable of bringing down from the hills a sudden spate; the crossing
      could have been made a million times in such circumstances without peril
      greater than is to be met with in stepping across a moorland drain. Yet
      now the one thing happened that made it dangerous.

      At some little distance up stream there stood a mill, the water power of
      which was so arranged, that if the sluice of the mill should for any
      reason be suddenly closed, that body of water which normally flowed down
      the mill dam after turning the wheel, was discharged into the river some
      way above the stepping stones. In the narrow channel of the Eden at this
      point, this sudden influx of water was quite sufficient to raise the
      stream's level to a height most dangerous to anyone who at the time might
      be in the act of crossing by these stones. Unhappily, at the exact moment
      when the three poor girls were stepping cautiously and with none too
      certain foot from stone to stone, and had reached to about mid-channel,
      the miller, ignorant of their situation and unable from where he stood to
      command a view to any distance down stream, closed his sluice. Down Eden's
      bed surged a wave crested like some inrushing sea that sweeps far up a
      shingly beach. In an instant the three girls, <span class="pagenum">066</span><a
      name="link066" id="link066"></a>afraid to make a dash for the safety of
      the hank, were swept off the stones where they clung, and were carried
      shrieking down the swollen stream. One, Miss Ramsay, buoyed to a certain
      extent by the nature of her dress, floated until she was able to grasp the
      overhanging branch of a tree, and she succeeded in getting out. The other
      two, rolled over and over, buffeted by the sudden turmoil of waters, were
      swept away and drowned. No one was near to give help; none even heard
      their cries.

      On the southern bank of Tweed, a mile or two up the river from Coldstream
      and Cornhill, stands all that is left of Wark Castle, a place once of
      formidable strength, and greatly famed in Border history. Except a few
      green mounds, and portions of massive wall, there remains now but little
      to speak of its former greatness, or to remind one of the mighty feats
      that were performed here during its countless sieges and bloody fights.
      But the old Northumbrian saying still tells its tale with grim simplicity:

    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Auld Wark upon the Tweed

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding this couplet, the following comment is made in the <i>Denham
      Tracts</i>: "Mark's history, from the twelfth down to at least the
      sixteenth century, is perhaps without a parallel for surprises, assaults,
      sieges, blockades, surrenders, evacuations, burnings, restorations,
      slaughters. These quickly recurring events transformed the mount on which
      the castle stood into a Golgotha, and gave a too truthful origin to the
      couplet which still occurs on the Borders of the once rival kingdoms." The
      castle was erected during the reign of King Henry I., by Walter d'Espec,
      somewhere about the year 1130; and before it had been many years in
      existence, in 1135, David I. of Scotland captured it. From that time
      onwards, at least down to 1570, when Sussex spent a night within its walls
      on his way to harry Teviotdale, there is not one item of that formidable
      list of "surprises, assaults, sieges, blockades, surrenders, <span
      class="pagenum">067</span><a name="link067" id="link067"></a>evacuations,
      burnings, restorations, slaughters," that has not been amply borne out by
      its history, many of them again and again. David took it in 1135, but
      restored it to England in the following year. Twice afterwards, the same
      monarch vainly attempted to take it by storm, but finally, after the fall
      of Norham, he reduced it by means of a long blockade. After this it
      remained in Scottish possession till 1157, when England again seized, and
      at great expense rebuilt, the castle. In 1216 it was destroyed by fire; in
      1318, reduced by King Robert the Bruce; in 1385, taken by storm by the
      Scots. Then in 1419, William Halliburton of Fast Castle surprised the
      English and took the castle, putting all the garrison to the sword. But
      the same fate was dealt out to the Scots themselves a few months later;
      Sir Robert Ogle and his men gained access to the building by way of a
      sewer from the kitchen, which opened on the bank of Tweed. Creeping up
      this unsavoury passage, they in their turn surprised and slew the
      Scotsmen. Again in 1460, after the widow of James II. had dismantled
      Roxburgh and razed it almost to the foundations, the Scots forded Tweed
      and retook Wark. But they did not hold it long. More valuable now to the
      English than ever it had been before, owing to the loss of Roxburgh, it
      was partially repaired by them, only, however, to be again pulled down by
      the Scots before the battle of Flodden; after which Surrey for the last
      time restored and strengthened it. After the accession of James VI to the
      throne of England, Wark, like other Border strongholds, began to fall into
      decay; the need for them was gone. Buchanan, the historian, has left a
      description of Wark as it was in 1523, when he was with the Scottish army
      at Coldstream, which then besieged it. "In the innermost area," he says,
      "was a tower of great strength and height; this was encircled by two
      walls, the outer including the larger space, into which the inhabitants of
      the country used to fly with their cattle, corn, and flocks in time of
      war; the inner of much smaller extent, but fortified more strongly by
      ditches and <span class="pagenum">068</span><a name="link068" id="link068"></a>towers.
      It had a strong garrison, good store of artillery and ammunition, and
      other things necessary for defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion the Scottish commander sent against the castle a picked
      force of Scottish and French troops, supported by heavy siege artillery,
      all under the command of Ker of Fernihurst. "The French," says Sir Walter
      Scott, "carried the outer enclosure at the first assault, but were
      dislodged by the garrison setting fire to the corn and straw laid up in
      it. The besiegers soon recovered their ground, and by their cannon
      effected a breach in the inner wall. The French with great intrepidity
      mounted the breach, sustaining great loss from the shot of that part of
      the garrison who possessed the keep; and being warmly received by the
      forces that defended the inner vallum, were obliged to retire after great
      slaughter. The attack was to have been renewed on the succeeding day, but
      a fall of rain in the night, which swelled the Tweed and threatened to cut
      off the retreat of the assailants to the main army, and the approach of
      the Earl of Surrey, who before lay at Alnwick with a large force, obliged
      the Duke [of Albany] to relinquish his design and return into Scotland."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wark, it is said, once belonged to the Earl of Salisbury, and the tale is
      told how, in the time of King David Bruce, a gallant deed was done by Sir
      William Montague, Lord Salisbury's governor of the castle. King David,
      returning from a successful foray into England, passed close to Wark,
      making for the ford over Tweed at Coldstream, and his rear-guard, heavily
      laden with plunder, was seen from the castle walls by Montague's garrison.
      The rear was straggling. Such an opportunity was not to be wasted. The
      Governor, with forty mounted men, made a sudden dash, slew a great number
      of the Scots, cut off one hundred and sixty horses laden with booty, and
      brought them safely into the castle. David instantly assaulted the place,
      but without success; and he thereupon determined to take it by siege.
      There was but one way whereby the place might be saved; a message must be
      conveyed to King Edward III., <span class="pagenum">069</span><a
      name="link069" id="link069"></a>who was then on his way north with a great
      army. The risk was great; failure meant death, and the castle was closely
      invested. Sir William himself took the risk. In a night dark and windy,
      with rain falling in torrents, the Governor dashed out on a swift horse
      and cut his way through the Scottish lines before almost the alarm had
      been raised; and so rapidly did Edward advance on hearing of the plight of
      the garrison, that the rear of the Scottish force was barely over the ford
      before the English van had reached the southern bank of Tweed. It is of
      this occasion that the more or less mythical tale of King Edward and the
      Countess of Salisbury's Garter is told. In the great Hall of Wark Castle
      the story finds a dubious resting place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countless war-like events that have taken place in and around Wark
      give to the place an interest which is perhaps hardly appreciated by the
      majority of us, and that interest is largely added to when one thinks of
      the many characters noted in history who from time to time sojourned
      within its walls. King Stephen lay here with a large army in 1137; Henry
      III remained in the castle for some time with his queen in 1255; in 1296
      Edward I paid it a visit: Edward II mustered here his army in 1314 before
      his crushing defeat at Bannockburn, and, as already stated, Edward III,
      after he had driven off the Scottish marauding force, was entertained here
      for a time by the Countess of Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wark, one thinks, would be an ideal place in which to conduct excavations,&mdash;though,
      indeed, a little in that line has already been undertaken. In the volume
      for 1863-68 of the "Proceedings of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club," it
      is recorded that a good many years ago Mr. Richard Hodgson had traced a
      wide sewer to the north of the castle, opening on to the river bank. This
      sewer is said to be so wide that it might easily have been used for the
      passage of men or material. Probably it was by this bidden way that Sir
      Robert Ogle in 1419 forced his way into the interior. But if the opening
      was so wide, <span class="pagenum">070</span><a name="link070" id="link070"></a>how
      came it to be undefended? Was there a traitor inside who kept guard that
      night, a Northumbrian perhaps, masquerading as a Scot, whose burr did not
      betray him? In the course of his investigations Mr. Hodgson came also on a
      "long flight of stone steps leading from the keep to the outer court, with
      a portcullis about half way." Quantities of cannon balls have also been
      found, but there must surely be unlimited scope for the discovery of such
      like treasure trove in the fields surrounding the castle, and down by the
      ford where so many armies of both nations have crossed Tweed. They did not
      always make a leisurely and altogether unmolested passage.

      Kelso,&mdash;with Melrose the most pleasing of the towns on Tweed,&mdash;we
      pass the meeting of the waters of Tweed and its largest affluent, Teviot.
      Kelso has a fine airy square, good streets, and an air of quiet gentility,
      neighboured as it is by Floors, the palatial seat of the Duke of
      Roxburghe, and by the trees of Springwood Park, the residence of Sir
      George Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now in the region of the clan of Ker of Cessford, from which the
      ducal family descends: while the Lothian branch descends from the Kers of
      Fernihurst. The name, Ker, is said to mean "left handed," and like the
      left handed men of the tribe of Benjamin, the Kers were a turbulent and
      grasping-clan, often at deadly feud with their neighbours and rivals, the
      Scotts of Buccleugh. These, with the Douglases, for long predominant, were
      the clans that held the Marches, and freely raided the English Borderers,
      while they fought like fiends among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the early sixteenth century that the chiefs of the two branches
      of Ker, or Kerr, and of the Scotts, become more and more prominent in
      history, both as warriors and politicians. From these Houses the Wardens
      of the Border were often chosen, and were not to be trusted to keep order;
      being more disposed to use sword and axe. Within a century the chiefs
      <span class="pagenum">072</span><a name="link072" id="link072"></a>throve
      to Earl's estate, and finally "warstled up the brae" to Dukedoms.

      Meanwhile the Douglases, for long the most powerful House in Scotland, the
      rivals of the Crown, were crushed by James II, and of the Douglases, Sir
      George, of Springwood Park, is descended from the House of Cavers, (on
      Teviot, below Hawick), scions sprung from Archibald, natural son of the
      Earl of Douglas who fell at Otterburne (1388) and is immortal in the
      ballad. The whole land is full of scenes made famous by the adventures of
      these ancient clans; they may be tracked by blood from Hermitage Castle to
      the dowie dens of Yarrow and the Peel Tower on the Douglas burn.

    <p>
      Sir Herbert Maxwell, in "The Story of the Tweed" (p. 139) not unnaturally
      laments the "sadly suburban" name of Springwood Park, standing where it
      ought not, in place of the <span class="pagenum">073</span><a
      name="link073" id="link073"></a>ancient name of Maxwell, originally
      "Maccus whele," "the pool of Maccus," on Tweed.

      Maccus was a descendant of the primeval Maccus, who, before the Norman
      Conquest, signed himself, or was described, as Maccus Archipirata, "the
      leading pirate." To a later Maccus David I gave the salmon fishing at
      Kelso; the pool, called "Maccus whele" became Maxwell, and the lairds "de
      Maxwell." The Maxwells moved to the western Border to Caerlaverock and
      into Galloway; and of all <span class="pagenum">074</span><a name="link074"
      id="link074"></a>this history only the name, "Max wheel," of a salmon cast
      below the pretty bridge of Kelso, is left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name Kelso is of Cymric origin: <i>calch myadd.</i> "Chalk hill." To
      be sure, as the man said of the derivation of <i>jour</i> from <i>dies</i>,
      the name is <i>diablement change en route</i>. The ruins of Kelso Abbey
      are the chief local remains of the Ages of faith. When David I, not yet
      king, brought French Bénédictines to Scotland, he settled them in Ettrick
      Forest. Here they raised the schele chirche&mdash;the Monastery, on a
      steep hill above Ettrick (now Selkirk), and here they "felt the breeze
      down Ettrick break" with its chill showers, and wept as they remembered
      pleasant Picardy; the climate of Selkirk being peculiarly bitter. David,
      when king, moved his Benedictines to the far more comfortable region of
      Kelso, or "Calkow," where they began to build in 1128. The style of their
      church is late Norman, and the tower was used in war as a keep in the
      fierce wars of Henry VIII. The place was gutted and the town burned by
      Dacre, in 1523; and suffered again from Norfolk, in 1542, and Hertford in
      1545. Henry VIII chivalrously destroyed this part of the border from the
      cottage to the castles of the Kers and the pleasant holy places of the
      Church, during the childhood of his kinswoman, Mary Stuart, Queen of
      Scots. His aim was always to annex Scotland; and, of course, to introduce
      the Gospel. In 1545, after overcoming the garrison of the church tower,
      Hertford's men wrecked the whole place, leaving little more than we see to
      day; though that little is much compared with what the Reformers have left
      of St. Andrews and Lindores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelso saw more than enough of very ugly fighting in those days; not even
      her monks stood aloof when blows fell fast and their cloisters were
      threatened. In 1545, twelve monks and ninety laymen gallantly held the
      Abbey against the English, and when at length Hertford's guns created a
      practicable breach, they retreated to the church tower. Hill Burton says,
      in his History of Scotland, that then "the assault was given to the
      Spaniards, but, when they rushed in, they found the place Kelso Abbey.
      <span class="pagenum">075</span><a name="link075" id="link075"></a>cleared.

      The nimble garrison had run to the strong square tower of the church, and
      there again they held out. Night came before they could be dislodged from
      this their last citadel, <span class="pagenum">076</span><a name="link076"
      id="link076"></a>so the besiegers had to leave the assault till the
      morning, setting a good watch all night about the house, which was not so
      well kept but that a dozen of the Scots in the darkness of the night
      escaped by ropes out at back windows and corners, with no little danger of
      their lives.

      When the day came, and the steeple eftsoons assaulted, it was immediately
      won, and as many Scots slain as were within." So may Kelso Abbey be said
      to have been finally wrecked; though, fifteen years later, the Reformers
      did their own little bit of work in the same line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbey buildings, however, or part of them, continued to be used long
      after this date; from 1649 to 1771 the transept, roughly ceiled over,
      served as the parish church, but it was given up in the year last
      mentioned owing to a portion of the roof falling in whilst service was
      being held. The kirk "skailed" that day in something under record time;
      Thomas the Rhymer's prediction that "the kirk should fall at the fullest"
      was in the people's mind, and they stood not much upon the order of their
      going.

      In 1745, Kelso for two days saw Prince Charlie, in his feint against
      General Wade; from Kelso he turned to Carlisle, his actual, and by no
      fault of his, hopeless line of invasion of England. The Prince's own
      strategy, as he wrote to his father, was "to have a stroke for't," as near
      the Border and as promptly as possible He therefore wished to cross the
      Tweed near Kelso, and beat up the quarters of the senile Marshal Wade at
      Newcastle. If he discussed Wade to the same tune as he had settled Cope,
      English Jacobites might join him. Holding Newcastle, he could thereby
      admit French reinforcements, while, if defeated, he was near the sea, and
      had a better route of retreat than if he were defeated going by Carlisle
      and the western route, in the heart of England. His council of chiefs,
      unhappily, forced him to take the western route. Halting at Kelso, he sent
      the best of the Border <span class="pagenum">078</span><a name="link078"
      id="link078"></a>cavaliers, Henry Ker of Graden, to make a feint on Wade;
      he rode as far as Wooler, near Flodden. Next day the Prince marched up
      Teviot, and up Jed, to Jedburgh, with the flower of the fighting clans;
      then up Rule water, another of the tributaries of Tweed, to Haggiehaugh on
      the Liddell, and so into England near Carlisle. Of old he would have
      picked up the Kers, Elliots, and Scotts; Haggiehaugh, where he slept, is
      Larriston, the home of the Elliot chief, "the Lion of Liddes-dale." But
      the tartans waved and the bagpipes shrilled in vain, and the Blue Bonnets
      did not go over the Border. One of the writers of this book possesses the
      armchair in which the Prince rested at Haggiehaugh.

      It was at Kelso, one remembers, that Sir Walter Scott first met James
      Ballantyne, with whose fortunes his own were afterwards to become so
      inextricably blended. Scott was then but a growing boy f his health had
      been giving trouble, and he was sent by his father to stay for six months
      with an aunt "who resided in a small house, situated very pleasantly in a
      large garden to the eastward of the churchyard of Kelso, which extended
      down to the Tweed." During the time of Scott's stay, Ballantyne and he
      were class-mates under Mr. Lancelot Whale, master of the Kelso Grammar
      School. The acquaint ance then formed was never quite broken off, and all

      and separated from Tweed by but a narrow flat haugh, stands all that is
      left of Roxburgh Castle,&mdash;a few isolated portions of massive wall
      defended on the north and, <span class="pagenum">079</span><a

      At the west end a very deep cutting divides this ridge from the high

    </p>
    <p>
      Ditch and cutting apparently were in former times flooded with water run
      in from Teviot, for even as late as the end of the eighteenth century
      remains of a weir or dam could still be <span class="pagenum">080</span><a
      name="link080" id="link080"></a>seen stretching across the river. No trace
      of it now remains. Those who razed the castle took care that the dam
      should be broken beyond repair, and countless winter floods have long
      since swept away the little that may have been left. Close to the castle
      probably stood the once important town of Roxburgh, with its streets and
      churches, its convent and schools, and its Mint, where many of our
      Scottish coins were struck. Where are those streets and churches now? Not
      a trace of them is to be found. The houses were of wood, no doubt, and
      easily demolished, but the churches, the convent, and the Mint, one would
      expect to have been of build substantial enough to leave some indication
      of where they had stood. Roxburgh, more than any other Border town,
      experienced the horrors of war. Her castle was one of four great Scottish
      strongholds&mdash;Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, Roxburgh&mdash;and it
      mattered little whether it were temporarily held by England or by
      Scotland, on the inhabit ants of the town fell the brunt of those horrors.
      Castle and town were continually being besieged, continually changing
      hands, sometimes by stratagem&mdash;as when on Shrove Tuesday, 1314, the
      Good Sir James Douglas, with sixty men, surprised the garrison and took
      the castle from the English;&mdash;sometimes by siege and assault, as when
      James II was killed by the bursting of "the Lion," one of his own clumsy
      pieces of ordnance, a gun similar to that ancient weapon, "Mons Meg,"
      which is still to be seen in Edinburgh Castle. To the Queen of James II
      was due the complete destruction of Roxburgh as a stronghold. The castle
      had been for something like a hundred years continuously in England's
      hands,&mdash;a rankling sore in Scotland's body. The knife must be used
      unflinchingly. Under her orders, therefore, when the castle was captured
      after James's death, the place was thrown down and made entirely
      untenable; and probably at this time also the dam across Teviot was cut,
      thus permanently emptying fosse and ditch. Roxburgh ceased then almost
      entirely to be a place of <span class="pagenum">081</span><a name="link081"
      id="link081"></a>strength, and time and decay have wiped her out; no man
      may-say where stood any portion of a town which, in point of population,
      was once the fourth most important burgh in Scotland. Of the last siege,
      and the death of James, the historian Pitscottie writes: "The King
      commanded the souldeouris and men of weir to assault the castell, but the
      Inglischemen défendit so walieiantlie within, the seige appeirlt so to
      indure langer nor was beleiffit, quhairthrow the King déterminât to
      compell them that was within the house be lang tairrie to rander and gif
      it ower." Reinforcements at this time arrived, "which maid the King so
      blyth that he commanded to chairge all the gunnis to gif the castell ane
      new wollie. But quhill this prince, mair curieous nor becam him or the

      stood, an old thorn tree which is said to mark the spot where the King
      fell.

      But there lingers yet one relic of the days when her Markets and Trysts
      were famed throughout the country. St. James's Fair, which w-as held at
      Roxburgh as long ago as the days of King David I, is still kept each
      August in the pleasant haugh by the ruins of the castle, between Teviot
      and Tweed. There, on a little eminence, the Town Clerk of Jedburgh each
      year reads this Proclamation: "OYEZ, OYEZ, OYEZ." <span class="pagenum">082</span><a
      name="link082" id="link082"></a>Whereas the Fair of St. James is to be
      held this &mdash;&mdash;th day of August 19&mdash;&mdash;, and is to
      continue for the space of eight days from and after this proclamation.
      Therefore, in name and authority of Our Sovereign King George V, by the
      Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, King,
      Defender of the Faith, and in name and authority of the Honourable the
      Provost and Bailies of the Royal Borough of Jedburgh, and in name and
      authority of a High and Potent Prince the Duke of Roxburgh, and his Bailie
      of Kelso, I make due and lawful proclamation that no person or persons
      shall presume to trouble or molest the present Fair, or offer any injury
      one to another, or break the King's peace,&mdash;Prohibiting all old Feuds
      and new Feuds, or the doing of anything to disquiet the said Fair, under
      the highest pains of law. As also&mdash;that no person or persons make any
      private bargains prejudicial to the customs and Proprietors of said Fair,&mdash;Certifying
      those who contravene any part of said customs that they will be prosecuted
      and fined according to law. "GOD SAVE THE KING."
    </p>
    <p>
      In these degenerate days, the Fair lasts but one day in place of eight,
      and Feuds, new or old, are unknown. But not so very long ago the rivalry
      at this Fair of the neighbouring towns of Kelso and Jedburgh was very
      bitter. Roxburgh had ceased to be, indeed, but the Fair survived, and it
      chanced that the Provost and Bailies of Jedburgh&mdash;like Roxburgh, a
      Royal burgh,&mdash;having under some old charter acquired a right to
      "proclaim" the Fair and collect the market dues, duly came in state each
      August in order to exercise this privilege at the ancient stance. Now,
      Kelso in the course of time became a larger and more important town than
      Jedburgh; it is, moreover, in close proximity to the ground on which the
      Fair is held, whereas Jedburgh was no better than a foreign land, miles
      removed&mdash;ten, at least,&mdash;from Roxburgh. Hence Kelso resented
      what it considered to be an outrage on the part of her officious
      neighbour. What was Jedburgh that she should oust them from those market
      tolls and dues! A beggarly interloper, no less! The outcome of such a
      frame of mind was generally what might be expected amongst men whose
      forebears for many <span class="pagenum">083</span><a name="link083"
      id="link083"></a>hundreds of years had been fierce fighters. As the
      procession of Jedburgh magistrates, all in their robes and escorted by a
      compact body of townsmen, advanced towards the place of proclamation,
      taunts of "Pride and Poverty!"&mdash;"Pride and Poverty!" were hurled at
      their ears by the irritated men of Kelso. "Doo Tairts an' Herrin' Pies!"
      fiercely retorted Jedburgh's inhabitants. It is difficult now-a-days to
      see where came in the sting of the original taunt, or the appositeness of
      the "Countercheck Quarrelsome." But in those old days they were amply
      sufficient. Some man, more hasty, or less sober, than his neighbour would
      follow up the taunt by a push or a blow, and St. James's Fair was speedily
      as lively a spot as now could be any Fair even in Ireland. Kelso and
      Jedburgh were "busy at each other"; and sometimes one prevailed, sometimes
      the other. An attempt that Kelso once made to hold the Fair on its own
      side of the river was utterly defeated; Jedburgh marched across the bridge
      and made things so warm that the experiment of shifting the venue of St.
      James's Fair has never been repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt, when Roxburgh ceased to be a Royal Burgh, its rights naturally
      devolved on Jedburgh, the only other Royal Burgh in the country. But
      Jedburgh tradition tells of a time when the English, taking advantage of
      heavy floods which prevented Kelso men from crossing the river, raided the
      Fair and carried off rich plunder. Then Jedburgh, coming to the rescue,
      smote the English and recaptured the booty, and for their gallant conduct
      were awarded those privileges which they still exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kelso taunt of "Pride and Poverty" may possibly have originated from a
      custom to which the economical burgesses of Jedburgh seem to have been
      addicted. In a letter written in 1790, Sir Walter Scott mentions that when
      he himself visited the Fair in that year, he found that, there not being
      in possession of the men of Jedburgh enough riding boots to accommodate
      all the riders in the procession, the magistrates had ruled that only the
      outside men of each rank should wear boots, or, rather <span
      class="pagenum">084</span><a name="link084" id="link084"></a>each a boot
      on his <i>outer</i> leg. Thus, as the men rode in threes, one pair of
      boots would be sufficient to maintain the dignity of each rank,&mdash;a
      device worthy of Caleb Balderstone himself. It is easy enough to assign an
      origin to "Pride and Poverty," but the local custom which gave occasion
      for the bitter taunt of "Doo tairts and Herrin' Pies" is baffling. There
      are many such taunts in the Border, hurled by town at rival town. "Selkirk
      craws," is the reproach flung at that burgh by its neighbour, Galashiels;
      and
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Galashiels Herons, lockit in a box,

    <p>

      is, or was, the jibe that stung Gala lads to fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before quitting the subject of Roxburgh, it may be of interest to mention
      that in the churchyard of the present village of that name there is a
      gravestone to the memory of the original of Edie Ochiltree, the bluegown
      of Sir Walter's <i>Antiquary</i>. Andrew Gemmels was his name. He died in
      1793 at Roxburgh Newtown, a farm on the banks of Tweed a few mi es from
      Roxburgh, at the great age of one hundred and six.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first tributary received by Teviot on the right bank is the Kale
      Water, running through the parish of Linton, which was in King David's
      time an appanage of Kelso Abbey. The church has been restored, but the
      walls are, like those of Kelso, Norman work, and in the porch is an
      enigmatic piece of sculptors' work; apparently somebody is fighting a
      dragon&mdash;Sir Herbert Maxwell suggests St. George, but St. Michael was
      the more orthodox dragon slayer. About the object grew an aetiological
      myth; a Somerville of old times
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Slew the Worm of Worrnes glen

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The dragon-slaying story is found in most parts of the world, from Troy to
      Dairy in the Glenkens. Here the Worm twisted himself round the Mote, or
      tumulus (apparently the basis of an old fort), and was killed by the local
      blacksmith. <span class="pagenum">085</span><a name="link085" id="link085"></a>In
      1522-1533, Linton tower was among the scores of such Border Keeps which
      the English destroyed. They could hold their own against a Border raid;
      not in face of a regular English army. Roxburghshire was not so deeply
      tainted by Covenanting principles as Galloway, Lanarkshire, and the
      south-west, Ayrshire and Renfrewshire. Covenanters needed wild hills and
      wild wastes. They are said to have held coil venticles in a deep glen of
      Kale; but, as a rule, they knew enough to preach in places of wide
      outlook, where they could detect the approach of parties of dragoons. In
      the bed of a burn they would be at great disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tower more interesting than that of Linton, namely Ormistoun, fell when
      Linton fell; but it must have been rebuilt, for here, in Mary Stuart's
      day, dwelt the Black Laird of Ormistoun, James, with Hob, his brother, two
      of Bothwell's most cruel and desperate "Lambs." The Black Laird was with
      Bothwell, Hay of Talla (on upper Tweed), and one of Bothwell's own clan,
      Hepburn of Bowton, when they placed the powder under Darnley's chamber in
      Kirk o'-Field (February 9-10, 1567), and so, in the feeling words of
      Bothwell, "sent him fleeing through the air." After doing another deed as
      treacherous as this murder, the Black Laird was taken, tried, and hanged
      in 1573. Bothwell was Warden of the Border, which he ruled from Hermitage
      Castle on the Liddel water, and all these loose Border lairds rode and
      slew at his bidding. They had probably, in that twilight of faith, no
      religion in particular; Catholicism lingered in the shape of oaths,
      Calvinism was not yet well settled in these regions. But, probably in
      prison, the Black Laird "got religion." He professed to be of the Elect,
      and confident of his salvation, while he drew a dark enough picture of
      life among lairds of his quality. On the day of his hanging he said, "With
      God I hope this night to sup.... Of all men on the earth I have been one
      of the proudest and most high-minded, and most filthy of my body. But
      specially, I have shed innocent blood <span class="pagenum">086</span><a
      name="link086" id="link086"></a>of one Michael Hunter with my own hands.
      Alas, therefore, because the said Michael, having me lying on my back,
      having a pitchfork in his hand, might have slain me if he pleased, but did
      it not, which of all things grieves me most in conscience. Within these
      seven years I never saw two good men, nor one good deed, but all kinds of
      wickedness."
    </p>
    <p>
      This wretch, once on his feet, must have butchered some poor hind who had
      spared him. In reading Pitcairn's <i>Criminal Trials</i>, and the Register
      of Privy Council for the period of the Reformation, we find private war,
      murder, and rapine to have been almost weekly occurrences, from the Upper
      Tweed to the Esk. The new Gospel Light made the darkness visible, and we
      see robberies and vendettas among the dwellers in the peel towers, of
      which the empty shells stand beside every burn in the pleasant lands then
      clouded with smoke from blazing barn and tower and cottage. The later
      Ormistouns had "particularly deadly feud" with the Kers of Cessford; the
      Kers annexed their lands, and the last Ormistoun was a public hangman; the
      ancestral Orm was a flourishing and pious gentleman of the twelfth
      century, a benefactor of the early monks of Melrose. Meanwhile, the castle
      of Cessford, the ancestral hold of that line, is not far from a place
      called Morbattle in the Black Laird's day, and now,<span class="pagenum">087</span><a
      name="link087" id="link087"></a> more pleasantly, Morebattle. The name has
      no connection either with festivity or feud, and "More" is not the Celtic
      <i>mor</i>, "great." "More" is "mere," a lake, and "botl" is Anglo-Saxon,
      "a dwelling." Cessford Castle had the name to be only second to Bothwell's
      castle of Dunbar, and Logan of Restalrig's eyrie on a jutting rock above
      the sea, Fastcastle. In the great English raid of 1523, "Dand Ker," Sir
      Andrew, the head of the clan, rather feebly surrendered the place, which
      was secure in walls fourteen feet thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting find was made at Cessford in 1858. Whilst excavating, a few
      yards from the north wall of the castle, a workman unearthed a very fine
      old sword, and a dagger, both in fair preservation. The dagger measured
      about twenty-six inches, and bore on its blade the Scottish Thistle,
      surmounted by a crown. The sword was basket hilted, richly carved and
      embossed in silver. It measured forty inches in length; on one side of the
      blade was the Scottish Crown; on the other, the date 1511.<span
      class="pagenum">088</span><a name="link088" id="link088"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Ker of Cessford, tradition tells, who in 1622 tried to carry off
      the goods and gear of Hobbie Hall of Haughhead, father of the famous
      Covenanter, Henry Hall. Hobbie, apparently, was quite able to take care of
      himself, as is testified by a large stone which stands on a knoll amid
      trees, near Kale water, on which is carved:

      Higher up than Kale comes Oxnam (locally, Ousenam) Water, which joins
      Teviot hard by Crailing. Once a nice trout stream, there is not left at
      this day much to tempt the angler whose dreams are of giant fish, though
      doubtless many a "basket" can be caught of fingerlings. In none of the
      Border streams, unhappily, is any restriction made as regards the size of
      the fish that may be taken. Everything goes into the creel of the fisher
      with worm in "drummly" waters, and of the holiday sportsman; moved by no
      compunctions, trammelled by no absurd qualms,&mdash;to them a fish is a
      fish; and as the latter, at least, probably never even sees a big trout,
      he attaches vast importance to the capture of a "Triton of the minnows."
      The writer, who had one day fished a Border river with all the little
      skill at his command, and had succeeded neither with dry fly nor with wet
      in capturing anything worthy to be kept, once came upon a sportsman of
      this holiday breed, rigged out with all the latest appliances which should
      inevitably lure the wiliest of trout from his native element. He "had had
      a splendid day," he said, in reply to enquiries. "What had he got them
      with? Oh-h, Fly." but what fly, he would not say. It was just "fly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might he see the basket?" the baffled enquirer asked Proudly the lid was
      thrown back, and the contents displayed&mdash;a basket half filled with
      parr, and with trout, not one of which could have been six inches in
      length. Thus are the streams depleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a pleasant valley, that of the Oxnam. Across it runs the old Roman
      Road,&mdash;in days not very remote a favourite camping place of gipsies,&mdash;and
      up the valley to the south lies that noble sweep of blue hills, the
      Cheviots, smiling and friendly enough in summer, but dour and forbidding
      when the north east blast of winter strikes their blurred and gloomy
      faces.<span class="pagenum">089</span><a name="link089" id="link089"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Did those "muggers" and "tinklers," who of old frequented the Roman Road
      that runs south over Teviot and Jed and Oxnam, and away over the Cheviots
      down into Rede valley past Bremenium (High Rochester), did they ever come
      upon buried treasure or hoarded coins, one wonders. It is not many years
      since a well-known Professor, as he sat resting one day by the side of the
      old Road a little farther south than Oxnam valley, idly pushed his walking
      stick into a rabbit hole close to where he was seated. A few scrapes with
      the point of the stick, and something chinked and fell; then another, and
      another. But this buried treasure consisted only of copper coins, a vast
      number, none very rare; and no farther search revealed anything of value.
      Yet there must be plenty along that route, if one could but chance upon
      the proper spots. And surely, wherever there befell one of those countless
      fights or skirmishes that were for ever taking place in these Border
      hills, both in the days of the Romans and since, there must lie buried
      weapons. At Bloodylaws, up Oxnam, for instance. The {89}name is
      suggestive; but what occurred there, one cannot say&mdash;though there is
      the vague tradition of a mighty battle that left Oxnam for three days
      running red with blood. The country people, if you enquire from them the
      name of that hill, pronounce it with bated breath;&mdash;"Bluidylaws,"
      they say in lowered voice. But I doubt that their tone is less the effect
      of old unhappy tradition telling how some great slaughter took place here,
      than the fact that "bluidy" is a word banned by the polite. This "three
      days red with blood," too, is an expression curiously common in the
      account given by country folk of any battle of which they may have local
      tradition. You will rind it used in connection with at least half a dozen
      other places in the Border-land besides Bloodylaws; and in the ballad of
      "The Lads of Wamphray" there occurs the line: "When the Biddes-burn ran
      three days blood." Wamphray is in Annandale, and the fight alluded to was
      between the Johnstons and the Crichtons in 1593. But the affair was a mere
      skirmish; "three days blood" is but a figure of speech in this and
      probably in most other instances. Still, on a spur of Bloodylaws there
      exists a well-defined circular camp, and there may be foundation for the
      local tradition of some grim slaughter.

      CHAPTER IV JEDBURGH, AND THE JED

      miles up Teviot from the junction of Oxnam Water, we come to Jed, a
      beautiful stream, on whose banks dreams the pleasant county town where,
      close on ninety years ago, they cried that cry of which they do not now
      like to think&mdash;"Burke Sir Walter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the Border there stands no place more picturesquely situated than
      Jedburgh, nor in historical interest can any surpass it. And though its
      ancient castle, and the six strong towers that once defended the town,
      have long since vanished, there remain still the noble ruins of its
      magnificent abbey, and other relics of the past, less noticeable but
      hardly less interesting; whilst the surrounding countryside brims over
      with the beauty of river, wood, and hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      History gives no very definite information as to the date at which first
      took place the building of a castle at Jedburgh, but it appears certain
      that as early as the year 950 a.d. there existed in these parts some great
      stronghold, if, at least, "Judan-byrig"&mdash;where, when he had
      suppressed an insurrection in Northumbria, King Edred of England confined
      the rebel Archbishop of York&mdash;may be identified with "Jedburgh."
      Probably, however, there was in this neighbourhood a castle of sorts long
      prior to the date above mentioned, for both "Gedde-wrdes," or "Jedworths,"
      the old and the new, were known <span class="pagenum">091</span><a
      name="link091" id="link091"></a>settlements before the expiry of the
      earlier half of the ninth century, and in those turbulent days no
      community was rash enough to plant itself in hamlet or town except under
      the protecting shield of castle or strong place of arms.

    </h5>
    <p>
      In any case, before the end of the eleventh century, there certainly
      existed at Jedburgh a castle of formidable strength, which at frequent
      intervals continued to be used by the Scottish kings as a royal residence.
      Here, in 1165, died Malcolm the Maiden. From Jedvvorth was issued many a
      Charter by Malcolm's predecessor, David I, by William the Lion, by
      Alexander II. Here, too, the queen of Alexander III bore him a son in the
      year 1264; and here at a masque held after Alexander's second marriage in
      1285, appeared and vanished the grizzly skeleton that danced a moment
      before the king, threading its ghastly way through the ranks of dismayed
      guests; frightened women shrank screaming from its path, men brave to face
      known dangers yet fell back from this horror, hurriedly crossing
      themselves. An evil omen, they said, a presage of misfortune or of death
      to the highest in the land. And surely the portent was borne out, for less
      than six months saw Scotland mourning the violent death of her King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like its not distant neighbour, the more famed castle of Roxburgh,
      Jedburgh castle as time went on became a stronghold continually changing
      hands; to-day garrisoned by Scots, to-morrow held by English, taken and
      retaken again and again, too strong and of importance too great to be
      anything but a continuous bone of contention between the two nations, yet
      more often, and for longer periods, in English than in Scottish keeping.
      When in the summer of the year 1316, King Robert the Bruce went to
      Ireland, Sir James Douglas was one of the wardens left by him in charge of
      the Scottish Kingdom. Jedburgh Castle, probably with a garrison far from
      strong, was then in English keeping. Douglas established himself at
      Lintalee, little more than a mile up the river<span class="pagenum">092</span><a
      name="link092" id="link092"></a> from Jedburgh, where, by throwing across
      the neck of a promontory between the river and a precipitous glen,
      fortifications which even now are not quite destroyed, he converted a post
      of great natural strength into a position almost unassailable. Here, or in
      the immediate neighbourhood, in 1317 he inflicted two severe defeats on
      separate bodies of English troops, detachments from a larger army under
      the Earl of Arundel. As the outcome of these victories, Jedburgh Castle
      was probably regained by the Scots, for the English monks in Jedburgh
      Abbey were expelled by their Scottish brethren in February, 1318, a step
      they would scarcely have dared to attempt had an English garrison still
      been in the castle. In 1320 town and castle were bestowed by the Bruce on
      Sir James Douglas, and five years later the grant was confirmed, with
      further additions of land. But in 1334 Edward Baliol, who two years
      earlier had assumed the Crown of Scotland, handed over to King Edward III,
      to remain for ever in the possession of England, amongst other places, the
      town, castle, and forest of Jedworth. These Edward now bestowed on Henry
      Percy, thus providing ground for a very pretty quarrel between the
      Douglases and <span class="pagenum">093</span><a name="link093"
      id="link093"></a>Percies. From now onward, practically for seventy-five
      years, Jedburgh Castle remained in English hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, its fate was as that of a land wilfully devastated by its own
      people to hamper the march of an invading army. If the Scots could not
      permanently hold it, neither, they resolved, should it any more harbour
      those vermin of England. Accordingly, when in 1409 the men of Teviotdale,
      fierce progenitors of the more modern reiving Border Elliots and Scotts,
      wiping out the English garrison, retook the castle, they at once set about
      its final destruction. Burnt, so far as it would burn, cast down bit by
      bit to its very foundations, with strenuous toil riven asunder stone from
      stone, ere their work was ended little part of its massive walls remained
      to speak of former glories. Walter Bower, Abbot of Inchcolm, who was a
      young man at the time of its destruction writes in the "Scotichronicon"
      that: "Because the masonry was exceedingly holding and solid, not without
      great toil was it broken down and demolished."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perched above the town on a commanding eminence that on one side sloped
      steeply to the river, and on the other to a deep glen or ravine, defended
      also, doubtless, on the side farthest from the burgh by a deep fosse, the
      castle must once have been of great strength&mdash;how strong as regards
      position may best be judged from the bird's-eye view of it to be gained if
      one climbs at the back of Jedburgh the exceedingly steep direct road that
      runs to Lariton village. From this point, too, one sees to advantage the
      venerable Abbey nestling among the surrounding houses, and can best
      appreciate the wisdom of the old monks, who chose for their abode a site
      so pleasant. A valley smiling in the mellow sunshine; a place to which one
      may drop down from the heights above where bellows and raves a north
      westerly gale, to find peace and quiet, undisturbed by any blustering
      wind; a valley rich in the fruits of the earth, and wandering through it a
      trout stream more beautiful than almost any of the many beautiful Border
      "Waters," a stream <span class="pagenum">094</span><a name="link094"
      id="link094"></a>that once was, and now should be, full of lusty yellow
      trout rising under the leafy elms in the long, warm, summer evenings. An
      ideal water for trout in Jed, and many a pretty dish must those old monks
      have taken from it, by fair means or foul; pity that woollen-mills below,
      and netting, and the indiscriminate slaughter of fingerlings, above the
      town, should have so greatly damaged it as a sporting stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly upper Jed is not now quite so bad as it was a few years ago, but
      what of the lower part of that beautiful river? The same may be said of it
      that may be said of Teviot immediately below Hawick, or of Gala, and,
      alas! of Tweed, below Galashiels. The waters are poisoned by dyes and by
      sewage, rendered foul by sewage fungus, reeking with all manner of
      uncleanness, an offence to nostril and to eye. Five and thirty years ago
      Ruskin wrote: "After seeing the stream of the Teviot as black as ink, a
      putrid carcase of a sheep lying in the dry channel of the Jed, under
      Jedburgh Abbey, the entire strength of the summer stream being taken away
      to supply a single mill, I know finally what value the British mind sets
      on the beauties of nature." What, indeed, are the 'beauties of nature'
      that they should interfere with the glories of commerce! Truly we are a
      Commercial Nation. Here is the condition of things that Ruskin found in
      the Borderland in the mid-seventies of last century, as described by him
      in a lecture delivered at Oxford in 1877.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years ago," he said, "I went, for the first time since early youth to
      see Scott's country by the shores of Yarrow, Teviot, and Gala Waters."
      Then to his hearers he read aloud from "Marmion" that picture of the
      Border country which is familiar to everyone:

      "What I saw myself, in that fair country," continued Ruskin, "of which the
      sight remains with me, I will next tell you. I saw the Teviot oozing, not
      flowing, between its wooded banks, a mere sluggish injection, among the
      poisonous pools of scum-covered ink. And in front of Jedburgh Abbey, where
      the foaming river used to dash round the sweet ruins as if the rod of
      Moses had freshly cleft the rock for it, bare and foul nakedness of its
      bed, the whole stream carried to work in the mills, the dry stones and
      crags of it festering unseemly in the <span class="pagenum">096</span><a
      name="link096" id="link096"></a>evening sun, and the carcase of a sheep,
      brought down in the last flood, lying there in the midst of the children
      at their play, literal and ghastly symbol, in the sweetest pastoral
      country in the world, of the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
    </p>
    <p>
      That is how these once fair scenes struck the outraged eye of one who was
      a sincere lover of our beautiful Border land. What might he say of these
      rivers now that five and thirty years have passed? Compared to Teviot, ink
      is a fluid that may claim to be <i>splendidior vitro</i>, and Jed below
      the town is in little better case.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, to return to Jedburgh. Of the old castle no trace now remains;
      but early in the nineteenth century a small portion of one wall yet stood,
      some outline of foundations yet met the eye. Probably the fosse was filled
      up when the buildings were razed&mdash;it was a convenient place to shoot
      rubbish; indeed, when about 1820 the site was being cut down preparatory
      to the erection of a new "castle" (until recent years used as a County
      Prison), charred oaken beams and blackened stones were unearthed, relics
      certainly of the ancient building. A few coins have also been found, and
      at various dates an iron lock, a key of curious design, a rusty dagger,
      arrowheads, and portions of a gold chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jedburgh, deprived of her castle, was yet a strong place; but if her
      townsmen and the fierce men of Teviotdale imagined that by harrying and
      destroying the nest that so long had sheltered them, the English birds of
      prey would be permanently-scattered down the wind, they made a vast
      mistake. No more than a year had passed ere the English returned under Sir
      Robert Umphraville and burned the town about their ears; and in 1416 the
      same commander repeated the performance of six years earlier. Again and
      again as the years rolled on were fire and sword the fate of Jedworth. The
      town, with its flanking towers, was strong, strong in natural position,
      and, owing to the manner of building of its houses, difficult of access
      except by one or other of its four ports; but it had no walls or <span
      class="pagenum">097</span><a name="link097" id="link097"></a>defending
      fosse, and however brave its men, however skilled in the use of arms,
      their numbers were generally too meagre to cope with the formidable bands
      the English could bring against them. Time and again the place was sacked,
      and on each occasion her magnificent Abbey suffered grievously at the
      hands of the stormers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded about the year 1118, the ancient Abbey occupies the site of a
      building more ancient still by probably two or three hundred years, a
      church built in the ninth century by Ecgred, Bishop of Lindisfarne, who
      died A.D. 845. Osbert was the first Abbot of Jedburgh (1152-1174);
      previous to his day the establishment ranked merely as a Priory. In the
      troublous times between 1297 and 1300, the Abbey suffered much. Sacked and
      partially destroyed, the lead stripped from its roof, the conventual
      buildings to such an extent gutted that the brethren, fleeing, were forced
      to seek refuge for a time in Abbeys and Monasteries south of the Border,
      it can have been but the massiveness of its walls that then preserved it
      from total destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But compared to the treatment later meted out to Abbey and town by the
      Earl of Surrey, all former chastenings were as a comparatively mild
      scourging with whips; Surrey chastised with scorpions. In this matter, his
      little finger was thicker than the loins of those who had preceded him. In
      1523, an English force&mdash;compared to the meagre number of defenders, a
      vast army&mdash;marched on the town. All that human power could do in
      defence of hearth and home was done that day by the men of Jedworth. When,
      since history began, has it ever been recorded of them that they shrank
      from battle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "And how can man die better
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Than facing fearful odds,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      summed up their creed, then and ever. There were of them, now, but two
      thousand at the most, opposed to an army many times their number one man
      as against four, or perhaps even <span class="pagenum">098</span><a
      name="link098" id="link098"></a>as one to five. Yet so stubborn was their
      resistance, so fiercely they fought, that at the last it was only by the
      aid of fire that this wasps' nest was laid waste. Driven back at length by
      superior numbers, forced to retire to the towers and to the Abbey, the
      attack could be pushed home no farther till Surrey gave orders to set fire
      to the town. Even then, Jedworth held out till far in the night, when the
      entire place was little more than a smouldering heap of embers. "I assure
      your Grace," wrote the Earl to his King, "I fownd the Scottis at this tyme
      the boldest men and the hottest that ever I sawe any nation, and all the
      journey upon all parts of the armye kepte us with soo contynual skyrmish
      that I never sawe the like."... "Could 40,000 such men be assembled," he
      says in the same letter, "it would bee a dreadful enterprise to withstand
      them." If valour alone could have won the day, to the men of Jedburgh had
      now been the victory. They fought like fiends incarnate. The Devil
      himself, in truth, must have been amongst them, for, says Surrey farther:
      "I dare not write the wonders that my Lord Dacre and all hys company doo
      saye they sawe that nyght six tyms of sperits and fereful syghts. And
      universally all their company saye playnly the devyl was that nyght among
      theym six tyms."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was Jedburgh wiped out, "soo surely brent that no garnysons nor none
      others shal bee lodged there unto the tyme it bee newe buylded." And to
      rebuild equal to what it had been, would surely be no light undertaking,
      for, says Surrey, "the towne was much better than I went (weened) it had
      been, for there was twoo tymys moo houses therein than in Berwicke, and
      well buylded, with many honest and faire houses therein sufficiente to
      have lodged a thousand horsemen in garnyson, and six good towres therein,
      which towne and towres be clenely destroyed, brent, and throwen downe."
      The slaughter of Jedworth's defenders no doubt must also have been great.
      But that the inhabitants were not indiscriminately put to the sword is
      evidenced by the fact that some time during <span class="pagenum">099</span><a
      name="link099" id="link099"></a>the night, wlien Lord Dacre's picketed
      horses&mdash;terrified no doubt by the same Scottish devil that had
      troubled the hearts of the storniers in the town&mdash;suddenly
      stampeding, galloped wildly through Surrey's camp, over two hundred of
      them, bursting in amongst the still burning houses, were caught and
      carried off by the Scottish women who still clung to the place&mdash;"keening,"
      probably, over their devastated hearths. In all, before this stampede
      ended, Surrey lost upwards of eight hundred horses; for when the maddened
      beasts came thundering through his camp, the English soldiers, imagining
      that they were being attacked by a fresh army of Scots, loosed off into
      the mob flights of arrows, and fired into the terrified animals with
      musketry. It is scarcely the method best suited to calm a maddened mob of
      horses; little wonder that many in their helpless terror plunged over the
      great "scaurs," or cliffs, that near the town overhang Jedwater, and were
      dashed to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his letter of 27th September, to Henry VIII, Surrey thus describes the
      incident: "And he [Lord Dacre] being with me at souper, about viij a clok,
      the horses of his company brak lowse, and sodenly ran out of his feld, in
      such nombre, that it caused a marvellous alarome in our field; and our
      standing watche being set, the horses cam ronnyng along the campe, at
      whome were shot above one hundred shief of arrowes, and dyvers gonnys,
      thinking they had been Scotes that wold have saulted the camp; fynally,
      the horses w'ere so madde that they ran like wilde dere into the feld,
      above xv c at the leest, in dyvers companys; and in one place above felle
      downe a gret rok, and slew theymself, and above it ran into the towne
      being on fire, and by the women taken, and carried awaye right evill
      brent, and many were taken agayne. But, fynally, by that I can esteme by
      the nombre of theym that I sawe goe on foote the next daye, I think there
      is lost above viij c horses, and all with foly for lak of not lying within
      the campe." <span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>So,
      for a time, Jedburgh perished. But the recuperative power of settlements
      in those days was great&mdash;like the eels, they were used to the process
      of skinning&mdash;and in no long time a rejuvenated township sprang from
      the ashes of the old burgh. When Surrey gave orders that the towers should
      be "throwen downe," possibly his commands were not obeyed to the letter.
      In a district where a plentiful supply of stone is not lack ing, doubtless
      these defending towers would be massive buildings constructed of that
      material, run together&mdash;as was the custom in those days&mdash;with a
      semi-liquid mortar, or kind of cement, which, when it hardened, bound the
      entire mass into a solid block that clung stone to stone with
      extraordinary tenacity. Probably the towers may not have been so "clenely
      destroyed" as he supposed them to be. In any case, in twenty years' time
      the place was again formidable, its men as prone as had been their fathers
      to shout the old battle-cry of "Jethart's here," and fly at the throat of
      their hereditary foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the hereditary foe in any way reluctant to afford them
      opportunity. In 1544 Lord Evers stormed and captured the town; and again
      the roar and crackle of flaming houses smote on the ears of Jedburgh's
      women. According to an Englishman's account of "The late Expedition in
      Scotland made by the King's Highness' Army under the Conduct of the Right
      Honourable the Earl of Hertford, the year of owr Lord God 1544," an
      account "Sent to the Right Honourable Lord Russell, Lord Privy Seal; from
      the King's Army there, by a Friend of his," the men of Jedburgh on this
      occasion did not behave with their wonted valour. But if this writer is to
      be trusted, nowhere during Hertford's entire campaign of 1544 did the
      Scots make a stand. It was a sort of triumphal English progress;
      everywhere the Scots fled almost without striking a blow, everywhere they
      were cut down. Only occasionally, and almost as it were by accident, was
      an Englishman hurt, whilst the slaughter among the Scots was prodigious.
      They "used for their defence their light feet, and fled in so much haste
      that divers <span class="pagenum">101</span><a name="link101" id="link101"></a>English
      horses were tired in their pursuit: but overtaken there was a great
      number, whereof many were slain, partly by the fierceness of the
      Englishmen, partly by the guilty cowardice of the Scots.... And yet in
      this skirmish, not one Englishman taken, neither slain: thanks be to God."
      Everywhere it is the same story&mdash;a pleasant picnic for Hertford and
      his men; death and destruction, and panic flight for the Scots. Men,
      women, and children, it was all the same apparently in that campaign, if
      one may judge by incidents such as this at Dunbar: "And by reason that we
      took them in the mornynge, who, having wautched all nyghte for our comynge
      and perceyvynge our Army to dislodge and depart, thoughte themselves safe
      of us, were newly gone to their beds; and in theyr fyrste slepes closed in
      with fyre, men, women, and children were suffocated and burnt.... In these
      victories," comments this pious and humane scribe, "who is to bee moste
      highest lauded but God?" But war is a rough game, and such happenings were
      the natural outcome at that time of Henry's orders anent the giving of
      quarter, and to the "putting man, woman and child to fire and sword,
      without exception, when any resistance shall be made against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, at Jedburgh, "upon the approachment of the men to their entries, the
      Scots fled from their ordnance, leaving them unshot, into the woods
      thereabout, with all other people in the same town." Thereafter, having
      caught and slain something over one hundred and sixty Scots, with "the
      loss of six English men only," Abbey, and Grey Friars, the town, and
      "divers hostel and fortified houses" were sacked and given to the flames,
      "the goods of the same toune being first spoyled, which laded, at their
      departing, five hundred horses." Again, in his notice of the capture of
      Skraysburgh, "the greatest towne in all Teviotdale," we are told that "it
      is a marvellous truth.... not one Englishman was either hurt or wounded."
      A craven band, those Scots, it would appear, fallen strangely from the
      level at which Surrey had found them so few years before&mdash;<span
      class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a> "the boldest
      men and the hottest that ever I sawe any nation"; far sunk, too, beneath
      the level of their immediate descendants, the men who turned the day in
      the fight of the Redeswire in 1575. And yet one remembers to have heard of
      a certain fight about this period, in the near neighbourhood of Jedburgh,
      at a place called Ancrum Moor, when Angus, Arran, and Scott of Buccleuch,
      with a force numerically very inferior, turned the tables on the "auld
      enemy" to a lusty tune. It may all be quite accurate, of course, this
      story told to Lord Russell, but it smacks somewhat of a tale told by one
      who himself was not a very bold fighting man. The warrior whose place is
      ever the forefront of the battle is not the man who belittles his enemies,
      nor is he usually one who regards with complacency the sufferings of
      helpless women and children. Accurate, or not, however, Hertford seems to
      have had a partiality for harrying this district and slaying its hapless
      people, for he returned the following year with a larger following&mdash;a
      mongrel gang, in which Turks and Russians were almost the only European
      nations unrepresented&mdash;and completed his work of destruction so far
      as it lay in his power. He could not utterly destroy the glorious Abbey,
      but the Brethren were scattered, never to return, and so far as it could
      be done, the building that for four hundred years had sheltered them was
      wrecked. Mute now the solemn chants that had been wont to echo through its
      dim lit aisles, gone for ever the day of matins and vespers; in Jedburgh
      the sway of the Church was over. Black with the smoke of sacrilegious
      fires, stained by the flames that had licked its desecrated walls, still a
      rudely fitted fragment of the great Abbey for a little time continued to
      be used by worshippers; for the rest, the building would appear to have
      been regarded chiefly as an excellent and useful outlook or watch tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the followers of the Reformed Faith that next held public worship
      there. Did no one of the old-time Abbots who lie asleep within its ancient
      walls turn in his grave, one wonders, <span class="pagenum">103</span><a
      name="link103" id="link103"></a>when in 1793 the south aisle was pulled
      down, and "a wall built between the pillars to make the church more
      comfort able"?

      They had no room in their compositions for any sentiment of reverence,
      little use for such a thing as respect for historical buildings, those
      eighteenth century Scottish ancestors of ours. Our old foes of England at
      least had the excuse that what they did was done in the heat of conflict;
      it was left to our own people in cold blood to lay sacrilegious hands on a
      glorious relic of the past; like monkeys to deface and tear to pieces
      something the beauty and value of which they had not wit to recognise. All
      that could be done, however, to atone for past misdeeds was done in 1875
      by the Marquess of Lothian. The "comfortable church" of 1793 has <span
      class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>been removed,
      and what remains of the Abbey is reverently cared for. Safe now from

      and in the peace of long-drawn summer twilights only the distant cries of
      children, the scream of swift or song of thrush, may now set the echoes
      flying through those ruined aisles. The Presbyterian Manse that once stood
      in the Abbey grounds&mdash;itself no doubt, like other houses in the town,
      built wholly or in part of stone quarried from the Abbey ruins&mdash;has
      long since been removed, and little now remains which may break the
      tranquil sadness that broods over these relics of past grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hundred yards from the Abbey, down a back street, there stands a
      picturesque old house, robbed now of some of its picturesqueness by the
      substitution of tiles for the old thatched roof that once was there. It is
      the house where, in a room in the second story whose window overlooks a
      pleasant garden and the once crystal Jed, Mary, Queen of Scots lay many
      days, sick unto death,&mdash;a house surely that should now be owned and
      cared for by the Burgh. Local tradition (for what it may be worth) has it
      that the Queen lodged first in the house which is now the Spread Eagle
      Hotel, but that a fire breaking out there, she was hastily removed to that
      which now goes by the name of "Queen Mary's House." It stands in what must
      in her day have been a beautiful garden, sloping to the river. Hoary,
      moss-grown apple trees still blossom there and bear fruit. "With its
      screen of dull trees in front," says Dr. Robert Chambers, "the house has a
      somewhat lugubrious appearance, as if conscious of connection with the
      most melancholy tale that ever occupied the page of history." In those
      long past days, however, its appearance must have been far from
      lugubrious; and indeed even now, on a pleasant sunny evening of late
      spring when thick-clustered <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>apple and pear blossom drape the boughs,
      and thrushes sing, and Jed ripples musically beneath the worn arches of
      that fine

      bridge near at hand, (across which they say that the stones for building
      the Abbey were brought these many centuries agone), it is more of peace
      than of melancholy that the place speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there is sadness too, when one thinks of the&mdash;at least on <i>this</i>
      occasion&mdash;sorely maligned woman who lay there in grievous suffering
      in the darkening days of that October of 1566. "Would that I had died at
      Jedworth," she sighed in later years. She had been spared much, the Fates
      had been less unkind, if death had then been her part. And not least, she
      might have been spared the malignant slanders of the historian Buchanan,
      who, at any rate in this matter, showed himself a master of the art of
      suppressing the true and suggesting the false.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, according to Buchanan, news was brought to Mary at Borthwick Castle
      of the wounding of Bothwell by "a poor thief, that was himself ready to
      die,"&mdash;how, one wonders, would the famous "Little Jock Elliot" have
      relished that description of himself?&mdash;"she flingeth away in haste
      like a mad woman, by great journeys in post, in the sharp time of winter."
      As a matter of fact, when the news of Bothwell's mishap reached the Queen,
      she was already on her way to Jedburgh, to hold there a Circuit Court; and
      the time, of course, was not winter, but early October, not unusually one
      of the pleasantest times of the whole year in the south of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Jedburgh, says Buchanan, "though she heard sure news of his
      life, yet her affection, impatient of delay, could not temper herself, but
      needs she must bewray her outrageous lust, and in an inconvenient time of
      the year, despising all discommodities of the way and weather, and all
      danger of thieves, she betook herself headlong to her journey, with such a
      company as no man of any honest degree would have adventured his life and
      his goods among them." Buchanan's estimate of the Queen's escort on this
      occasion is not flattering to the Earl of Moray, (the "Good Regent,"
      Mary's half-brother,) the Earl ol Huntly, (Bothwell's brother-in-law,)
      <span class="pagenum">107</span><a name="link107" id="link107"></a>and Mr.
      Secretary Lethington, who formed part of that escort. These, one would
      suppose, were scarcely the men most likely to have been selected to
      accompany her had it been "outrageous lust" that prompted her journey. And
      as to this "headlong" dash to the side of the wounded Bothwell, of which
      Buchanan makes so much, they would call now by an ugly name such
      statements as his if they chanced to be made on oath. Buchanan must have
      known very well that the Queen transacted business for a week in Jedburgh
      before she set out to visit her wounded Warden of the Marches,&mdash;a
      visit which, after all, was official, and which under any circumstances it
      had been ungracious in her to refrain from making. There was no
      justification for speaking of her visit as "headlong," there is no warrant
      for such words as "hot haste," and "rode madly," which have been employed
      by other writers in speaking of her journey. If she made "hot haste"
      there, (at the end of a week devoted to business,) she made equally hot
      haste back again that same day. When one has to ride fifty or sixty miles
      across trackless hills and boggy moors in the course of a day in
      mid-October, when the sun is above the horizon little more than ten hours,
      there is not much time for loitering by the way; the minutes are brief in
      which one may pause to admire the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that she left Jedburgh soon after sunrise, (that is to say, at
      that time of year in Scotland, a few minutes before 7 o'clock) going, as
      she certainly must have done, across Swinnie Moor into Rule Water, thence
      across Earlside Moor and over the Slitrig some miles above Hawick, then up
      and between the hills whose broad backs divide Slitrig from Allan Water,
      up by the Priesthaugh Burn and over the summit between Cauldcleuch Head
      and Greatmoor Hill, thence by the Braidlee Burn into Hermitage Water, and
      so, skirting the Deer Park, on to the Castle,&mdash;she would do well, in
      those days when draining of swamp lands was a thing unknown, and the way,
      therefore, not easy to pick, if she did the outward journey in<span
      class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a> anything
      under five hours. Hawick local tradition claims that the Queen on her way
      to Hermitage visited that town, and rested for a time in what is now known
      as the Tower Hotel; and, as corroborative evidence, a room in that inn is
      said to be known as "Queen Mary's Room." It may be that she did pay a
      flying visit to Hawick, but the chances are against her having made such a
      detour. It would have considerably added to the length of her journey, and
      there can have been small time to spare for resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mid-October the sun sets a few minutes after 5 o'clock. Therefore, in
      returning, the Queen and her escort must have made a reasonably early
      start; for to find oneself, either on horseback or afoot, among peat bogs
      and broken, swampy ground after dark is a thing not to be courted. As it
      was, Mary and her horse were bogged in what has ever since been called the
      Queen's Mire, where years ago was found a lady's spur of ancient design&mdash;perhaps
      hers. The day had turned out wet and windy,&mdash;it is a way that October
      days have, after fine weather with a touch of frost,&mdash;and the Queen
      and her escort were soaked to the skin, bedraggled, and splashed to the
      eyes with black peaty mud from the squelching ground through which their
      horses had been floundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in these days, when the Border hills are thoroughly drained, you
      cannot ride everywhere across them in "hot haste" without having
      frequently to draw rein. What must they have been like in the sixteenth
      century, when, in addition to the rough, broken surface, and the steep
      braes, every hillock was a soaking mossy sponge, every hollow a possibly
      treacherous bog, when spots such as the "Queen's Mire" were on every hand,
      and every burn brimmed over with the clear brown water that the heart of
      the ardent trout fisher now vainly pants after? Going and coming, between
      Jedburgh and Hermitage, a party in Mary's day, travelling as she
      travelled, could not well have done the journey in less that nine hours.
      Truly it does not leave much time for the dalliance suggested by Buchanan,&mdash;<span
      class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109" id="link109"></a>more
      especially as the Privy Seal Register of that date testifies that the
      Queen transacted a not inconsiderable amount of public business whilst at
      the castle. But, poor lady, she could do no right in the eyes of certain
      of her subjects. She was a Catholic; and that was sufficient; even her
      very tolerance of other people's religion was an offence, a trap set for
      the unwary. Every suggestion of evil with regard to her conduct was
      eagerly seized on and greedily swallowed by her enemies and ill-wishers.
      It is so fatally easy to take away character. Especially, for some reason,
      in the case of one high in rank are certain people prone to believe evil,
      strangely gratified if they may be the first to unfold to a neighbour some
      new scandal against their betters. Away to the winds with Christian
      charity! All is fish that comes to <i>their</i> net; to them every
      scandalous tale is true, and needs no enquiry, provided only it be told
      against one of exalted station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Mary rode that day in the wind and the wet a matter of fifty or
      sixty miles. She was used to long rides, no doubt,&mdash;there was indeed
      no other means for her to get about the country,&mdash;and she was never
      one who shrank from rough weather. But wet clothes, if worn for too long a
      time, have a way of finding out any weak spot there may chance to be in
      one's frame, and the exposure and the wetting dealt hardly this time with
      the Queen. She was never physically strong, and of late a world of
      anxiety, worry, and sorrow, caused by the conduct of her husband, had
      drained the strength she possessed. Moreover, ever since her confinement
      three months earlier, she had been subject to more or less severe attacks
      of illness, accompanied by much pain. In her normal condition, probably
      the fatigue and exposure might have affected her not at all; now, it
      brought on a serious malady. By the morning of the 17th&mdash;the day
      following her long ride&mdash;she was in a high fever, and in great pain.
      As the disease progressed, she was seized with violent paroxysms, vomiting
      blood; and day by day her condition gave rise to ever more grave fear. She
      herself, believing that <span class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110"
      id="link110"></a>her end was at hand, took leave of the Earl of Moray and
      of other noblemen, expressing at the same time great anxiety regarding the
      affairs of the kingdom and the guardianship of her infant son after her
      death. But never throughout the illness did her courage falter. Lack of
      courage, at least, is a thing of which not even her bitterest enemies can
      accuse Mary Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the ninth day of this severe illness, after a
      particularly acute attack of convulsions, the Queen sank, and her whole
      body became cold and rigid. "Every one present, especially her domestic
      servants, thought that she was dead, and they opened the windows. The Earl
      of Moray began to lay hands on the most precious articles, such as her
      silver plate and jewels. The mourning dresses were ordered, and
      arrangements were made for the funeral." * John Leslie, Bishop of Ross,
      writing from Jedburgh at the time, says that on the Friday "her Majesty
      became deid and all her memberis cauld, her Eene closit, Mouth fast, and
      Feit and Armis stiff and cauld."

      Buchanan's account is that, after leaving Hermitage, "she returneth again
      to Jedworth, and with most earnest care and diligence provideth and
      prepareth all things to remove Bothwel thither. When he was once brought
      thither, their company and familiar haunt together was such as was smally
      agreeing with both their honours. There, whether it were by their nightly
      and daily travels, dishonourable to themselves and infamous among the
      people, or by some secret providence of God, the Queen fell into such a
      sore and dangerous sickness that scarcely there remained any hope of her
      life." It would be hard to conceive anything more poisonous than this, or
      anything less in accord with the facts. Buchanan's zeal outran his love of
      the truth; with both hands he flung mud at the Queen. In his eyes, any
      story against her was worthy of credence&mdash;or at least he wished it to
      appear so. As a matter of <span class="pagenum">111</span><a name="link111"
      id="link111"></a>fact, before Bothwell reached Jedburgh the Queen had been
      dangerously ill, and incapable of making any preparation to receive him
      had she wished to do so, for close on ten days, and the day after his
      coming she lay for several hours unconscious, and as one dead. Writing on
      24th October to the Archbishop of Glasgow, M. Le Groc, the French
      Ambassador, can only say that he hopes "in five or six days the Queen will
      be able to sign" a dispatch; but on the following day her illness again
      took an unfavourable turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left Jedburgh within fifteen days of the date of M. Le Croc's letter,
      not an excessive time in which to recover from an illness which admittedly
      had brought her to the point of death, and which must have left her in a
      condition of extreme weakness. Yet, according to Buchanan, this time of
      convalescence was devoted to "their old pastime again, and that so openly,
      as they seemed to fear nothing more than lest their wickedness should be
      unknown." His conscience must have been of an elastic nature, if, having
      any knowledge of the facts, he could so write; and if he had no knowledge
      of the farts, one wonders how it is possible that a man of his position
      and ability should commit himself to statements so foul and uncharitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at any cost, and by any means, he wanted to make out his case; and he
      knew his audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buchanan's bias against the unfortunate Queen was very great. It even
      caused him to lend himself here to the task of bolstering up the case of
      that petulant, contemptible creature, Darnley. In view of the latter's
      known degrading habits and evil practices, as well as of his general
      conduct towards the Queen, the following sentence from the historian's
      waitings is almost grotesque: "When the King heard thereof," [Mary's
      illness] "he hasted in post to Jedburgh to visit the Queen, to comfort her
      in her weakness by all the gentle services that he could, to declare his
      affection and hearty desire to do her pleasure." Of course Darnley did
      nothing of the sort. When he did come, (twelve days after her illness
      began,) he came <span class="pagenum">112</span><a name="link112"
      id="link112"></a>most reluctantly and tardily from his "halkand and
      huntand" in the west country. He "has had time enough if he had been
      willing; this is a fault which I cannot excuse," wrote M. Le Croc on the
      24th October.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Buchanan, Darnley, when he did reach Jedburgh, found no one
      ready to receive him, or "to do him any reverence at all"; the Queen, he
      says, had "practised with" the Countess of Moray to feign sickness and
      keep her bed, as an excuse for not receiving him. "Being thus denied all
      duties of civil kindness, the next day with great grief of heart he
      returned to his old solitary corner." A pathetic story, if it were wholly
      true; a heart-stirring picture, that of the "solitary corner." But all the
      King's horses and all the King's men could not have set Darnley back again
      in the place he had forfeited in the esteem of the Nobles, and in the
      esteem of the country at large. If the nobles were not pleased to welcome
      him, if he was forsaken of all friends, whose fault was that but
      Darnley's? "The haughty spirit of Darnley, nursed up in flattery, and
      accustomed to command, could not bear the contempt into which he had now
      fallen, and the state of insignificance to which he saw himself reduced."
      * Darnley was an undisciplined cub. It was the sulky petulance of a spoilt
      child, that delayed his visit to Jedburgh; it was the offended dignity of
      an unlicked schoolboy that took him out of it again so hurriedly. The
      Queen's sufferings were as nought, weighed in the scale against a petty
      dignity offended by the lack of "reverence" with which he was received in
      Jedburgh. Truly, Queen Mary at her marriage had "placed her love on a very
      unworthy object, who requited it with ingratitude and treated her with
      neglect, with violence, and with brutality." **

      Buchanan, the historian, Queen Mary's traducer, died in September, 1582.
      His contemporary, Sir James Melville of Halhill, in writing of him says he
      was "a man of notable endowments for his learning and knowledge in Latin
      poesy, <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>much
      honoured in other countries, pleasant in conversation, rehearsing at all
      occasions moralities short and instructive, whereof he had abundance,
      inventing where he wanted. He was also religious, but was easily abused,
      and so facile that he was led by every company that he haunted, which made
      him factious in his old days, for he spoke and wrote as those who were
      about him informed him; for he was become careless, following in many
      things the vulgar opinion; for he was naturally popular, and extremely
      revengeful against any man who had offended him, which was his greatest
      fault." Truly these phrases: "he spoke and wrote as those who were about
      him informed him"; "inventing where he wanted"; "easily abused, and so
      facile that he was led by every company that he haunted"; "extremely
      revengeful against any who had offended him," seem to be not without
      application to much of what he wrote regarding Mary Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 9th November Jedburgh saw its last of this most unfortunate among
      women. On that day the Queen and her Court set out for Craigmillar,
      travelling on horseback by way of Kelso, Home Castle, Berwick, and Dunbar.
      But the effects of that grievous sickness at Jedburgh long remained with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, in the days that are long dead, were the Burgh's royal visitors; but
      no figure more romantic in history has ever trod its streets than his who
      in 1745 passed one night there on his disastrous march southward. At no
      great distance from the house where Mary lay ill, stands a fine old
      building, occupied once by a being no less ill-fated than was the
      unfortunate Queen of Scots. In a "close" leading from the Castle gate you
      find the door of this house&mdash;on its weather-beaten stone lintel the
      date 1687. The sorely worn stone steps of a winding old staircase lead to
      rooms above, all panelled in oak. But as in the case of the "comfortable
      church" that once took away from the beauty and dignity of the grand old
      Abbey, so here the ruthless hand of modern "improvement" has been at work.
      The tenants of the building&mdash;there are several&mdash;pre<span
      class="pagenum">114</span><a name="link114" id="link114"></a>sumably
      finding the sombre oak all too gloomy to meet their view of what is
      fitting in mural decoration, have remedied this defect by papering the
      panels, and in some instances by giving them what is call "a lick of
      paint." Sadly altered, therefore, is the interior of the building from
      what it was that night in November, 1745, when Bonnie Prince Charlie slept
      within its massive walls. But the outside, with its quaint double sun-dial
      set in the wall facing the Castle-gate, is no doubt now as it was then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this visit, local tradition has not much to tell. There is the story
      that the advance guard of that section of the Prince's army which he
      himself led, marching from Kelso, reached Jedburgh on the Sunday when the
      entire community was at church, and it is said that a message was sent to
      the minister of the Abbey church requiring him to close the service and
      send his congregation home to prepare rations for the main body of the
      army. The order, if it were really given, was apparently not resented, for
      when the Prince himself marched in, the women of Jedburgh, at least,
      flocked into the street to kiss his hand. The regard and homage of the
      women he got here, as elsewhere, but of that of which he stood most in
      need, the swords of the men, he got none. As at Kelso, not a single
      recruit followed him. One, indeed, a neighbouring farmer, did ride in to
      join the Royal standard, but he was a day after the fair; the army had
      already marched. Did the sound that tradition says Jedburgh heard long ere
      the Prince's arrival, the sound as of an army on the march, the distant
      rumble of moving artillery, the tramp of innumerable feet, and the dull
      throb of drums pulsing on the still night air, scare Borderers away from
      his enterprise? Was it superstition, or was it a real lack of interest, or
      was it merely "canniness," that so effectually damped the ardour of
      recruits both at Kelso and at Jedburgh? Whatever the cause, no man
      followed him; only the blessings and good wishes of the women were his
      wherever he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving Jedburgh, the Prince's army made over the <span
      class="pagenum">115</span><a name="link115" id="link115"></a>hills in two
      divisions, one following the old Whele-Causeway (over which the main
      Scottish army marched on Carlisle in 1388, what time Douglas's flying
      column made a dash into England down the Rede valley from Froissart's
      "Zedon"); the other marching by Note o' the Gate, the neighbouring pass
      that runs between Dog Knowe and Rushy Rig. These were then the only two
      practicable ways over the hills into Upper Liddesdale. "Note o' the Gate"
      is a puzzle. What does the name mean? "Note" may be merely the Cumberland
      "Knot" or "Knote," a knob or projection on a hillside. I understand the
      term is common enough in that part of the country, as in Helmside Knot,
      Hard Knot, etc. But even if this word, though differently spelled, does
      bear the same meaning both in Cumberland and in Liddesdale, I do not know
      that it gets us any nearer the "Gate." There is no rugged pass here, no
      Gate between precipitous mountains. One explanation&mdash;for what it may
      be worth&mdash;comes from a tradition that the name was given by Prince
      Charlie himself, through his misunderstanding a remark made by one of his
      officers. As they tramped over the moorland pass, the Prince overheard
      this officer say to another: "Take note of the gait," <i>i.e.</i>, "Take
      note of the way." That night, when they were at Larriston, the Prince
      puzzled everyone by referring to something that had taken place back at
      "Note of the Gate." The story seems far fetched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a tale survives of the doings and iniquities of the Prince's wild
      Highlanders as they straggled over these lonely Border moors. "Straggled,"
      seems to be a more appropriate term than "marched," for, according to the
      testimony of eyewitnesses, the men appear to have kept no sort of military
      formation. Or at least what formation they did keep was of the loosest,
      and no check on plundering. It is a lonely countryside at best; human
      habitations were few and widely separated, but from the infrequent
      cottages, property of an easily portable nature took to itself wings as
      the army passed, <span class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116"
      id="link116"></a>and sheep grazing on the hills melted from sight like
      snow before the softening breath of spring. Once they caught and killed
      some sheep in a "stell," and they cooked one of them in an iron pot that
      lay in the stell, Unfortunately, they did not take the precaution to
      cleanse the pot, and the resulting brew disagreed so sorely with one of
      the thieves that the spot is called the Hielandman's Grave to this day.
      Some others, that evening when they were encamped, forced a man to kill
      and cut up sheep for them, and for this work he was given a guinea. The
      pay did not benefit him much; for a part of Highlanders, as the man went
      towards home, put a pistol to his head and made him refund. They tried the
      same game on a man named Armstrong, down on the Liddel at Whit-haugh Mill.
      But Armstrong was too much for them; one who shared the old reiver blood
      was not to be intimidated, and he knocked the pistol out of the hand of
      the threatening Highlander, secured it himself, and turned the tables most
      unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One unlooked-for result of the Prince's march through those desolate
      regions, was a very great increase in the number of illicit stills, and in
      the consumption of whisky that had paid no revenue to King George. So
      impressed were the Highlanders with the wild solitude of the glens on all
      sides of their line of march, and with the facilities presented by the
      amber-clear burns that tinkle through every cleuch, that when the rebels
      were returning from Derby, numbers of the men got no farther north than
      the hills of Liddesdale and the Border, but entered there on the congenial
      pastime of whisky-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the proportion of Borderers who followed Prince Charlie down into
      England, or throughout his campaign, was so very meagre, yet there lived
      among those solemn Border hills many faithful hearts, whose King he was to
      the end.

      were not only Highland hearts that were true to him. In her <i>Border
      Sketches</i>, Mrs. Oliver mentions a Hawick man, named Millar, who
      accompanied his master, Scott of Gorrenberry, all through the campaign of
      1745-46, and who to the end of his days had an undying devotion to his
      Prince, and till the day of the latter's death, an imperishable faith that
      he would come to his own again. Long after the '45, Miller became
      "minister's man" in one of the Hawick churches, and his grief, one Sunday
      morning in 1788, was overwhelming when the news was told to him that the
      Prince was dead. "E-eh! Doctor," he cried brokenly to his * reverend
      informant, "if I'll get nae good o' your sermon the day; I wish ye hadna
      telled me till this afternoon. If it had been the German Lairdie, now,
      there wad hae been little mane made for <i>him</i> But there'll be mony a
      wae heart forby mine this day." Indeed, who even now can read of Bonnie
      Prince Charlie's end, and <i>not</i> have "a wae heart"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of the Scottish Border towns in 1745 showed open hostility, or indeed
      anything but a luke-warm friendship, for the gallant young Pretender.
      Dumfries, however, was an exception. The inhabitants of that town, with
      men from Galloway, Nithsdale, and Annandale, full of zeal for King George
      and secure in the belief that the fighting men of the Prince's army were
      all safely over the March into England, hurried to intercept the rebel
      baggage train as it passed near Lockerbie, and carried off thirty-two
      carts to Dumfries. The Highlanders, however, getting word of this affair
      before the army marched from Carlisle, detached a party to Dumfries to
      demand the return of the waggons or the payment of an indemnity, "the
      notice of which has put Dumfries in greater fear and confusion than they
      have since the rebellion broke out, and expect no mercy." But the
      Prinnce's party was recalled before it had reclaimed the lost
      baggage-carts or exacted this alternative sum of £2,000, and Dumfries
      imagined that now all was weil. They had the waggons; and for a little
      <span class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>time
      they triumphed. So triumphant, indeed, were they, and so filled with
      confidence in their own warlike powers, that when false rumours reached
      them that the Highlanders had been utterly routed and cut to pieces at
      Lancaster, not only were there "great rejoicings in Dumfries by ringing of
      bells and illuminating their windows," but "a considerable party of our
      light horse were sent off immediately, after the Chevalier," and "about
      three hundred militia, composed of townspeople and the adjacent
      paroches... are to go to the water of Esk to stop their passing and to
      apprehend any small parcels of them flying." Dumfries was not so warlike a
      couple of weeks or so later, when Lord Elcho at the head of five hundred
      men of the Prince's advance guard marched in and demanded the immediate
      payment of £2,000 in money and the delivery of a thousand pairs of shoes,
      two hundred horses, and a hundred carts. Not all that the Prince demanded
      was paid before the northward march was resumed, but his visit cost the
      town something like £4,000&mdash;irrespective of what the Highlanders
      took. Whilst he remained in Dumfries, the Prince lodged in the Market
      Place, in a private house which is now the Commercial Inn. It is said that
      when his army marched up Nithsdale, halting for the night at the Duke of
      Queensberry's property, Drumlanrig, the Highlanders in the morning, to
      show their loyalty to King James, slashed with their swords portraits of
      King William and Queen Mary which had been presented to the Duke by Queen
      Anne,&mdash;an inconvenient method of declaring allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though of minor interest, there are other houses in Jedburgh besides Queen
      Mary's and that in which Prince Charlie lodged, in which the townsfolk
      take some pride. There is the building in which Sir David Brewster was
      born in 1781; that where Burns lodged when he visited Jedburgh in 1787;
      that in Abbey Close in which Wordsworth and his sister had lodgings in
      1803, when Sir (then Mr.) Walter Scott visited them and read to them part
      of the then unpublished "Lay of the Last <span class="pagenum">119</span><a
      name="link119" id="link119"></a>Minstrel"; there is the old Black Bull
      Inn,&mdash;no lunger an inn,&mdash;and interesting only as the place where
      in 1726 Sir Gilbert Eliott of Stobs stabbed Colonel Stewart of
      Stewartfield with his sword one evening as they sat at supper. Claret was
      plentiful and good in. Scotland in those days, and Colonel Stewart had not
      given his vote to Sir Gilbert, who was candidate for the county. Swords
      flew out on slender excuse in the eighteenth century. This particular
      sword was long kept in the family of Sir Gilbert Elliot's butler, and
      after passing through the hands of a resident in the village of Denholm,
      became the property of Mr. Forrest, the well-known gun-maker of Jedburgh,
      by whom it was finally deposited in the Marquess of Lothian's museum at
      Monteviot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jedburgh, of course, amongst other claims to distinction was famed for its
      witches&mdash;as what place was not, indeed, in times when harmless old
      women were adjudged innocent or guilty of the charge of witchcraft
      according as they sank or floated when thrown into deep water. If they
      sank&mdash;well and good, that meant that they were innocent, and they
      went to Heaven, having at any rate the satisfaction of knowing beforehand
      that, in such case, at least their memory would be cleared of the
      suspicion under which they had lain; if they floated&mdash;again well and
      good; that proved conclusively that the charge against them was a true
      one, and they were rescued from the water only to be burned alive. "Thou
      shalt not suffer a witch to live," was the text which our ancestors
      regarded as the Eleventh Commandment. We were not a whit better even at as
      late a date as the seventeenth century, than are those West African tribes
      of the present day whose medicine-men still "smell out" witches. Only, the
      West Africans practise the art now more or less in secret, and they are
      more humane in the death they inflict than were our ancestors; they do not
      burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jedburgh's testing place for witches was a pool below the spot where now
      the Townfoot Bridge crosses the river. There is a story told of a
      notorious witch who was ducked here along with <span class="pagenum">120</span><a
      name="link120" id="link120"></a>a batch of her sinful associates. No doubt
      <i>they</i> all floated right enough; their reputation as witches of the
      most mischievous description had long been almost too well established to
      need such a test as that of the river. But this is what led to their final
      overthrow. The chief witch of this "covine" had a husband, the village
      pedagogue, a man of repute for piety and for the rigour of his Sabbath
      keeping, and it was notorious that in season and out of season this good
      man would remonstrate with his wife&mdash;without doubt, people said,
      endeavouring to wean the woman from her sinful habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, one must of course admit that such continued efforts to save could
      not fail to be excessively irksome to any witch, and must goad not only
      her, but also her accomplices, as well as her Master, the Devil, to
      revenge. Hence, when the schoolmaster's dead body was found one fine
      morning floating in the river, the majority of the drowned man's
      neighbours had no hesitation in believing that his wife and her partners
      in iniquity had dragged him in the night from his hard-earned rest, and
      had thrown him into the deepest pool in Jed. And this was the more
      certain, because the deceased man had several times confided to friends a
      pitiful tale of how he stood in terror of his life, and how his wife and
      her "covine," had already more than once hauled him through the roughest
      streams of Jed. Sundry pious elders, moreover, affirmed that they had
      attended with him a sederunt of their church rulers the previous evening&mdash;when,
      perhaps, a trifle of something may have been taken in a quiet way to keep
      out the cold&mdash;and that at a late hour afterwards they accompanied him
      to his own door, whence, they admitted, they had come away in a hurry
      because of the wrathful and threatening tones in which they heard this
      witch addressing her husband. And this evidence was to some extent
      corroborated by the neighbours, who told how they had been awakened from
      sound sleep that night by the noise made by the poor victim loudly singing
      the twenty-third Psalm as the horrid troupe hurried him down the street
      towards the river&mdash;a rope <span class="pagenum">121</span><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a>about his neck, said some. Moreover, it
      was told, on evidence which people saw no reason to doubt, that at the
      time this poor man was being hurried to his death, a company of fairies
      was seen dancing on the top of the tower of Jedburgh Abbey, where after
      the drowning of the unfortunate schoolmaster by the witches, the whole
      company regaled themselves liberally with wine and ale. Certainly, both
      wine and ale <i>were</i> found to be missing from a neighbouring cellar
      the following day; and as the door of the cellar had been locked,
      obviously the loss could only be attributed to the schemes of fairies or
      witches. The one tale lent an air of truth to the others; therefore people
      were not backward in crediting both. He who accepted the story of the
      dancing fairies could have little difficulty in giving credence to that of
      the witches' "covine" dragging their unresisting prey through the streets.
      And so another wretched victim or two went to her long home by a fiery
      death. The schoolmaster was probably insane on some points, and trumped up
      the story of the witches having repeatedly ducked him. Our ancestors could
      swallow anything in the way of marvel. This story of the Jedburgh
      schoolmaster is told in "Historical Notices of the Superstitions of
      Teviotdale"; and it is added therein that popular tradition says that "a
      son of Lord Torpichen, who had been taught the art of witchcraft by his
      nurse," was of the party of witches, and that it was he who first gave
      information regarding the murderers.

      If, however, our forbears were drastic in their manner of dealing with
      witches and warlocks, and rigid in the infliction of capital punishment on
      criminals guilty of very minor offences, they were extraordinarily lax as
      regards the condition in which they kept their prisons. It is told that,
      sometime during the eighteenth century, the chief magistrate of Jedburgh
      was waited on by the burgh gaoler, who complained that the main door of
      the gaol had parted company with its hinges&mdash;which, in fact, had long
      been eaten through with rust. He had no means of securing his prisoners.
      What was he to do? It was a question calculated to puzzle any ordinary
      person. But the magistrate was a man of resource. "Get a harrow," said he.
      "And set it on end in the doorway, wi' its teeth turned inwards. If that
      winna keep them in,&mdash;'deed then they're no worth the keepin'." To as
      late a date as 1833, Selkirk also was not much better off than this, as
      regards its prison. The writer of the Statistical Account of the Parish at
      that date complains that prisoners "<i>have been frequently in the
      practice of coming out in the evening, and returning again before the
      jailor's visit in the morning.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      If by chance there was ever a period of his life when the Poet Burns was
      <i>not</i> susceptible, it certainly was not at the time when he visited
      Jedburgh in 1787. Regarding that visit he has left in his diary some very
      characteristic notes. He was "waited on by the magistrates and presented
      with the freedom of the burgh," he records; he meets and dines with "a
      polite soldier-like gentleman, a Captain Rutherfurd, who had been many
      years in the wilds of America, a prisoner among the Indians," and who
      apparently rather bored the poet. Captain Rutherfurd's adventures were
      assuredly such as could not fail to be well worth listening to, but what
      between Burns' respectful <span class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124"
      id="link124"></a>admiration of an armchair that the old soldier possessed,
      which had been the property of James Thomson, author of "The Seasons," and
      his latest attack of love's sickness, host and guest do not seem to have
      been quite in accord. Perhaps the old soldier prosed, and told his battles
      o'er again to too great an extent&mdash;it is a failing not unknown in old
      gentlemen; perhaps the poet wanted to compose a sonnet to his new
      mistress's eyebrows.&mdash;or whatever may have been Burns' equivalent.
      (He had just met by the "sylvan banks" of Jed a young lady possessed of
      charms that ravished his too tender heart). Anyhow, he left the district
      in a very despondent frame of mind, relieved only by such consolation as
      might be gleaned from presenting the lady with a copy of his latest
      portrait. In his diary is the following entry: "Took farewell of Jedburgh
      with some melancholy, disagreeable sensations. Jed, pure be thy crystal
      streams and hallowed thy sylvan banks! Sweet Isabella Lindsay, may peace
      dwell in thy bosom uninterrupted, except by the tumult throbbings of
      rapturous love! That love enkindling eye must beam on another, not on me;
      that graceful form must bless another's arms, not mine." Burns' loves were
      almost as many in number as the birds of the air, and scarcely less
      trammelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one proceeds up Jed from the ancient royal burgh, probably the first
      thing that forces itself on the mind is that the old coach road was not
      constructed for present-day traffic. In less than a couple of miles the
      river is crossed no fewer than four times by bridges which are curiously
      old fashioned, turning blindly across the stream in some instances almost
      at right angles to the road, and in the steepness of their ascent and
      descent conveying to the occupant of a motor car a sensation similar to
      that given to a bad sailor by a vessel at sea when she is surmounting "the
      league-long rollers." Nor are some of the gradients on the road a few
      miles farther out such as entirely commend themselves to motorists, two or
      three of them being as abrupt as one in twelve, and one in thirteen. <span
      class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125" id="link125"></a>Nevertheless
      the beauties of road and country are great, especially if it should chance
      that a visit is paid to the district when the tender flush of early Spring
      lies sweet on Jed's thick-wooded banks, and the trout have begun to think
      at last of rising again freely to the natural fly. Or better still,
      perhaps, when the green and gold, the russet and yellow, the crimson of
      Autumn combine with and melt into the crumbling red cliffs,&mdash;surely
      more generous tinted than ever were cliffs before. Above, a sky of
      tenderest blue, an air windless yet brisk, and just a leaf here and there
      fluttering leisurely into the amber clear water that goes wandering by;
      and from the hushes the sweet thin pipe of a robin, or the crow of
      pheasant from some copse. That is the Indian Summer of Scotland, her
      pleasantest time of year,&mdash;if it were not for the shortening days,
      and the recollection that trout fishing is dead till another season.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a heavily wooded district this in former days, and one or two of
      the giants of old still survive,&mdash;the widespreading "Capon tree," for
      instance, that you pass on the road a mile from Jedburgh (but why "Capon"
      it passes the knowledge of man to decide); and the "King of the Woods,"
      near Fernihirst, a beautiful and still vigorous oak, with a girth of 17
      feet, four feet from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right, across the river, as you begin to quit the precincts of the
      town, there hangs the precipitous red "scaur" over which, that grim night
      in 1523, Surrey's horses came streaming, an equine cascade. Farther on, a
      mile or so, there perches Douglas's camp at Lintalee. But his "fair manor"
      is gone, and that great cave in the face of the cliff where he kept stock
      of provisions "till mak gud cher till hys men"; a fall of rock swept away
      that, or most part of it, in 1866. It was to this cave, within Douglas's
      camp, that in 1317 a priest named Ellis brought a body of three hundred
      English soldiers, whilst Douglas was elsewhere, dealing with Sir Thomas
      Richmond and his men. But, (as the song says), Father Ellis "had better
      have left that beggar alone." Douglas returned <span class="pagenum">126</span><a
      name="link126" id="link126"></a>while yet the holy man and his unruly
      flock were feasting in the cave. And "then"&mdash;it is needless to say,&mdash;"there
      began a slaughter grim and great," and whatever else Father Ellis and his
      men had feasted on, at least they got now a bellyful of fighting. It was
      the last meal of which the most part of those Englishmen partook. The cave
      is gone, but there still remain, guarding the neck of the promontory&mdash;ruined
      indeed, and partially filled up, but still prominent to the eye&mdash;the
      double wall and fosse that Douglas threw across it six hundred years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of caves, such as this Douglas cave at Lintalee, there is a vast number
      scattered along the cliffy banks of Jed and Teviot, and by some of their
      tributary waters or burns. At Mossburn-foot, on Jed, there is a cave,
      others are at Hundalee, and elsewhere. Near Cessford Castle, on a small
      affluent of the Kale there is one, Habbie Ker's Cave, the same wicked
      Habbie&mdash;"a bloodie man in his youth"&mdash;whose ghost to this day
      walks by the old draw-well at the ruined castle of Holydene; on Kale
      itself there are several of considerable size; in the cliff overhanging
      Oxnam, near Crailing, are others, and at Ancrum, on the Ale; whilst at
      Sunlaws, near Roxburgh, in the red sandstone cliffs of Teviot, is a group
      of five caves, arranged in two tiers, some of them of fair dimensions, the
      largest about twenty six feet long, with a height of eight feet and a
      width of eight and a half feet. Another in the upper tier has a length of
      twenty three feet, but at the mouth is no more than three feet in height.
      In the lower tier, in one of the caves it is said in the Statistical
      Account that horses were hid in 1745, to save them from being taken for
      the use of the rebel army, when the detachment under Prince Charlie's own
      command marched from Kelso to Jedburgh. Many of the caves in different
      parts of the country are so well concealed that a stranger might pass very
      near to the mouth without suspecting their existence; some, on the other
      hand, force themselves on the eye. But probably in olden times thick
      undergrowth shut them from view. There <span class="pagenum">127</span><a
      name="link127" id="link127"></a>is no doubt that most of them at various
      times have been used as places of concealment; probably during the cruel
      old English wars they were much resorted to; certainly some of them were
      places of refuge in Covenanting times. Very efficient places of refuge no
      doubt they were, so long as the entrance was not discovered, but many of
      them would probably be easy enough to smoke out. It is mentioned in
      Patten's "Account of Somerset's Expedition into Scotland," how "a
      gentleman of my Lord Protector's... happened upon a cave in the grounde,
      the mouth whereof was so worne with fresh printe of steps, that he seemed
      to be certayne thear wear some folke within; and gone doune to trie, he
      was redily receyved with a hakebut or two. He left them not yet, till he
      had known wheyther thei wold be content to yield and come out, which they
      fondly refusing, he went to my Lord's grace, and upon utterance of the
      tbynge, gat licence to deale with them as he coulde; and so returned to
      them with a skore or two of pioners. Three ventes had that cave, that we
      wear ware of, whereof he first stopt up one; another he fill'd full of
      strawe, and set it a fyer, whereat they within cast water apace; but it
      was so wel maynteyned without, that the fyer prevayled, and thei within
      fayn to get them belyke into anoothur parler. Then devysed we (for I hapt
      to be with him) to stop the same up, whereby we should eyther smoother
      them, or fynd out their ventes, if thei hadde any mor: as this was done at
      another issue, about XII score of, we moughte see the fume of their smoke
      to come out: the which continued with so great a force, and so long a
      while, that we coulde not but thinke they must needs get them out, or
      smoother within: and forasmuch as we found not that they did the tone, we
      though it for certain thei wear sure of the toother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Who first made and used those caves, one wonders. The stone is soft, and
      easy to work, and I do not think it was beyond the skill and the tools of
      our very remote forbears to have patiently hollow'ed them out, in suitable
      places, from the <span class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128"
      id="link128"></a>solid face of the cliff. Tool marks may yet be plainly
      seen in some of them, marks not such as would be made by anything in the
      nature of a chisel, but such as are more suggestive of a pick, of sorts,
      an implement&mdash;single pointed&mdash;not unknown to even very primitive
      races.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scattered all over the Jedburgh district are many ancient camps&mdash;hoary
      even in the day when Douglas fortified Lintalee; many old castles and
      peel-towers, all, or nearly all, now in ruins, some indeed with very
      little left save tradition to indicate where once they stood; and here and
      there are found vestiges of chapels or shrines, of which possibly there
      may remain hardly more in some instances than the green mounds which cover
      their fallen walls. The monks wandered far up this pleasant vale of Jed,
      carrying the Gospel of Peace through a land that knew of little save war,
      but the history of their resting places is even more vague than is now the
      outline of their chapel walls. At Old Jed ward, however, five miles up
      stream from Jedburgh, you may still in some measure trace the line of
      foundations of that venerable little building which is said to have been
      built here away back in the ninth century. Of camps, the number is legion.
      That near Monklaw, the writer has not seen, but it is said to be Roman,
      and its measurements are something like one hundred and sixty yards each
      way. At Scraesburgh there is a circular camp, with a diameter of about one
      hundred and eighty feet, and with ramparts still nearly twenty feet in
      height,&mdash;surely that "Skraysburgh, the greatest towne in all
      Teviotdale," which, according to the English version, seems in 1544 to
      have fallen almost as fell Jericho of old, when the enemy shouted and blew
      their trumpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of castles and peel-towers the most are utterly ruined, but Fernihirst (to
      which we come presently), still stands, and, over the hill towards Teviot,
      Lanton Tower, the latter now incorporated with a comfortable modern
      dwelling. Lanton in the twelfth century was the property of Richard
      Inglis, who also owned the adjacent tower of Hunthill. Both these towers
      <span class="pagenum">129</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a>were
      sacked and burned in 1513, after Flodden, by an English flying column
      under Sir Roger Fenwicke, and its existence at the present day Lanton
      Tower may owe to the fact that when Evers swept the country side in 1544,
      and Hertford brought fire and sword in the following year, it had possibly
      neither been repaired nor was inhabited. It was over near Jedburgh, too,
      to have escaped the notice of Surrey in 1523. Hunthill was burned again in
      1549, and had Lanton then been anything but dismantled, it could scarcely
      have escaped the attentions of the party sent from Jedburgh by the Earl of
      Rutland to attack d'Essé's rear-guard at Ancrum ford. A force coming over
      the hill from Jedburgh and making for Ancrum would necessarily pass within
      easy hail of Lanton. In any case, however, there it stands, its solid
      walls of a tenacity not shared by buildings put together with modern
      mortar. Strange are the vicissitudes of places and of people. Over this
      Forest of Jedworth, and here at Lanton, where of old too often were heard
      the blast of trumpet, shouts and oaths of fiercely striving men, the roar
      and crackle of burning houses, you will hear now no sound more startling
      than the "toot-toot" of the Master's horn and the babble of fox hounds;
      for at Lanton Tower are the kennels of the Jedforest Hunt, and many a
      glorious run is had with this pack, sometimes in enclosed country,
      sometimes among the great round backed Border hills towards Carterfell,
      over country that will tail off all but the best of men and horses.

      CHAPTER V JED (continued), FERNIHIRST, RAID OK THE REDESWIRE, OTTERBURNE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>cross Jed, on a
      high and leafy bank nearly opposite to Lintalee, stands the picturesque
      old stronghold of Fernihirst. The original castle was erected by Sir
      Thomas Ker probably about the year 1476, and the present building dates
      only from 1598. Its predecessor "stode marvelous strongly within a grete
      woode," as Daere and Surrey found to their cost in 1523; yet they took it,
      after "long skirmyshing and moche difficultie," as Surrey reported. Brief
      and stormy was the existence of this original Fernihirst, stirring, and in
      some instances horrible, the deeds done within and around its walls. In
      1548 the English held it, Shrewsbury, when he returned to the south in
      that year, having left there a garrison of something like eighty or ninety
      men. At this period Scotland, still dazed and stricken under the stunning
      blow of Pinkie in 1547, was in a deplorable, and apparently a very
      helpless, condition. Most of her strongholds were in English hands; her
      chief men for the greater part had come in and made submission to
      Somerset; the poorer sort in most parts of the Border were at the mercy of
      the hated invader. Here, at Fernihirst, the English garrison was under the
      command of one whose oppression and cruel lust were devilish, and whose
      treatment of unprotected country-folk was such as would justify almost any
      conceivable form of revenge <span class="pagenum">131</span><a
      name="link131" id="link131"></a>on the part of the men of Jedforest. M. de
      Beaugué, a French officer who was then in Scotland, and who in his "<i>Histoire
      de la Guerre d'Ecosse</i>" chronicles the campaigns of 1548, 1549, says
      that during all the time this savage licentious devil remained near
      Jedburgh "he never came across a young girl but he outraged her, never an
      old woman but he put her to death with cruel torture."

      And, as the proverb has it: "Like master, like man"; where their captain
      forgot his manhood, and disgraced the name of Englishman, how were the men
      under his command likely to conduct themselves? The people of the Forest
      of Jedworth thus had ghastly wrongs to wipe out; and when their chance
      came, they seized on it with avidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cruelties inflicted on each other by both nations at this period were
      detestable and revolting. "Put men, women, and children to fire and sword
      without exception, when any <span class="pagenum">132</span><a
      name="link132" id="link132"></a>resistance shall be made against you,"
      wrote Henry VIII. to Lord Hertford in 1544, instructions which were most
      faithfully carried out. Here at Femihirst our countrymen went, if
      possible, "one better," and their treatment of prisoners was of the most
      inhuman and savage nature. Yet if their wrongs were such as are depicted
      by de Beaugué, can one wonder that, like wild beasts, they tore and
      mangled?
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1549 there came to Jedburgh a large body of French troops under
      the Sieur d'Essé, sent to recapture that town, which at the moment was
      held for the English by a force chiefly composed of Spanish mercenaries.
      The Spaniards made no great stand, and for the moment the Sieur and his
      little army were left with time on their hands. To the Sieur went Sir John
      Ker, then laird of Fernihirst, suggesting that the French general should
      aid him in recapturing the castle. French and Scots&mdash;a small body of
      the latter, the personal following of Sir John Ker&mdash;accordingly made
      a combined attack and quickly carried the outwork, the garrison retreating
      to the keep. Here, whilst a party laboured hard to effect a breach in the
      wall, French arquebusiers were so planted that no man of the garrison
      could show his face with impunity, or dared to attempt to interfere with
      the working party, who already in little over one hour had made a
      practicable breach, large enough at least to admit a man's body. About
      this time the main French force had come up, and the English garrison
      could not but see that their position was now desperate. Accordingly they
      showed a flag of truce, and the English commander, on receiving assurance
      that he would be allowed to return, came out through the hole in the wall
      and offered to give up the castle, provided that the lives of the garrison
      were spared. The Sieur d'Essé, however, would listen to no conditions; the
      surrender, he said, must be unconditional, and the Englishman therefore
      returned to his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, news of the attack on Fernihirst had flown abroad over the
      countryside, and men of Jedforest came <span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a>hurrying to the scene, breathless with the
      lust of slaughter, panting with unquenchable thirst for a bloody
      vengeance. Letting their horses go, and, regardless of everything, rushing
      in, they burst open and swarmed through the doors of the lower court. And
      now the bowels of the English leader turned indeed to water, for well he
      knew what fate would be his were he once to fall into the hands of those
      frenzied men. Therefore once more hurriedly pressing through the breach,
      he surrendered himself to two French officers, MM. Dussac and de la
      Mothe-Rouge. Scarcely, however, had he done so, and even as they led him
      away, a prisoner, there rushed up a Scot, a dweller in the neighbouring
      forest of Jed, one who had only too terrible a reason to remember the face
      of this fiend who had outraged his wife and his young daughter. He said no
      word, but with a roar as of a wounded beast that charges, he smote with
      all his strength. And the head of a man went trundling and bumping loosely
      over the trampled grass, as the knees doubled under a headless trunk that
      sank almost leisurely to the ground. Then those Scots who most had foul
      reason to execrate the memory of this treacherous brute, joyfully plunged
      their hands into his blood as it gushed, and with shouts of exultation
      seizing his head, they placed it on a long pole and stuck it up by a stone
      cross that stood by the parting of three ways, that all might see and
      rejoice over their vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was but the beginning of a scene long drawn and terrible in its
      ferocity. Prisoners were ruthlessly butchered, and when the Scots had
      murdered all whom they themselves had taken, their lust for blood was so
      far from slaked that they brought others from the Frenchmen&mdash;bartering
      even some of their arms in exchange&mdash;and slew these also with extreme
      barbarity. "I myself," writes M. de Beaugué, "sold them a prisoner for a
      small horse. They tied his hands and feet and head together, and placed
      him thus trussed in the middle of an open space, and ran upon him with
      their lances, armed as they were and on horseback.... until he was dead
      and his <span class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134" id="link134"></a>body
      hacked in a thousand pieces, which they divided among them and carried
      away on the iron points of their spears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot," naively adds the chronicler, "greatly praise the Scots for
      this practice, but the truth is the English tyrannised over the Borders in
      a most barbarous manner, and I think it was but fair to repay them, as the
      saying goes, in their own coin."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Sir John Ker got back his strong castle. But it did not long remain
      undisturbed in the family possession. In 1570 there came into Scotland
      that English expedition under the Earl of Sussex and Lord Hunsdon which
      played such havoc in the Border, and once more the Merse and Teviotdale
      were burned and laid waste. "Apon Monday last," writes Lord Hunsdon from
      Berwick to Sir W. Cecil, under date 23rd April, 1570, "beyng the 17th of
      thys ynstant, we went owt of thys towne by 6 a cloke at nyght and rode to
      Warke, where we remayned tyll three or four yn the mornyng; and then sett
      forward the hole army that was with us att that present, ynto Tyvydale
      bernyng on bothe hands at the lest two myle; levyng neythercastell, towne,
      nortowerunburnt tyllwecametojedworth. Many of the townes beyng Bukklews,
      and a proper tower of hys, called the Mose Howse, wythe three or four
      caves, wheryn the cuntrey folk had put such stufe as they had: and was
      very valyantly kept by serten of the cuntrey for two or three owars, but
      at last taken.... The next day we marchyd to Hawyke; wher by the way we
      began with Farnhurst and Hunthylle, whose howsys we burnt, and all the
      howsys about them. We could nott blow up Farnhurst, but have so torne ytt
      with laborars, as ytt wer as goode ley flatt." The building must have been
      of remark able solidity, for in spite of its being burnt, and left
      roofless and dismantled, "torne with laborars," in 1570, there can
      belittle doubt that in less than two years it was again at least tenable,
      for in 1572 Lord Ruthven, after dispersing at Hawick the forces of
      Buccleuch and Fernihirst, (who supported the cause of the abdicated
      Queen,) on his return march to Jedburgh "tuik the <span class="pagenum">135</span><a
      name="link135" id="link135"></a>housses of Pherniherst, and put men in
      them," and the place was held for some time after this by the King's
      troops. Possibly it was more thoroughly knocked about in 1593 than it had
      been at any other period of its existence. Sir Andrew Ker, then head of
      the house, when summoned to appear before James and his Privy Council at
      Jedburgh to answer for his part in aiding the schemes of the Earl of Both
      well, and for other acts, had failed to put in an appearance, and had
      consequently been outlawed and declared a rebel. It was also proposed to
      render him homeless, for on 16th October of that year Carey reports to
      Burghley that "the King has proclaimed to remain at Jedworth fifteen days,
      and summoned the barons, gentlemen and freeholders to attend him, minding
      this day or tomorrow to pull down the lairds of Fernhirst and Hunthill's
      houses, and all others who have succoured Bothwell." Probably the threat
      was carried into execution, to a greater or less extent. In any case, 1598
      saw a renovated Fernihirst, much as it stands at the present day, when,
      according to "Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland," it
      presents "a charming example of a Scottish mansion of the period." Built
      into the wall above the main doorway of the mansion, (as may be seen in
      Mr. Hugh Thomson's sketch,) are two panels, that to the left showing the
      armorial bearings of the Kers, and above, on a scroll, the words:
    </p>
    <h3>
      S. SOLIDEO
    </h3>
    <p>
      "forward in y" name of god"; at the foot, a.k. 1.5.9.8 On the panel to the
      right is the word "forward"; in the centre of the panel the arms of Sir
      Andrew's wife, Dame Ann
    </p>
    <h3>
      D. SOLIDEO
    </h3>
    <p>
      Stewart, and beneath, a.s. 1.5.9.8.
    </p>
    <p>
      As late as 1767 the house seems to have been occasionally used by the Lord
      Lothian of that day, but it was even then showing signs of dilapidation.
      It was, however, occupied by farming tenants down to a recent date, as
      late, I believe, as 1889. About that year extensive repairs were carried
      out; <span class="pagenum">136</span><a name="link136" id="link136"></a>the
      ivy which&mdash;however picturesque it may have been&mdash;was slowly
      throttling the old walls, was removed, the panels were refaced, the roof
      made wind and weather proof, and the interior to a great extent restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Smailcleuchfoot, a little higher up the river, and nearly opposite to
      Fernilhirst Mill, almost, as one might say, within a stone's cast of the
      castle, stood once the house of a man greatly famed in Jedforest,&mdash;Auld
      Ringan Oliver. No vestige of the house now remains, but the memory of
      Ringan and the story of the siege he stood within his cottage here still
      live in Border lore, and were sung of in James Telfer's "Border Ballads"
      close on a century ago.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Ringan's forebears, men of mark all of them in their day, dwelt here at
      Smailcleuchfoot for many a generation. They were there, no doubt, when the
      Sieur d'Essé recaptured Ferni-hirst for Sir John Ker; there when Dacre
      stormed it in 1523; there perhaps, helping Douglas, when Father Ellis and
      his Englishmen were caught feasting on the good fare at Lintalee in 1317.
      With ancestors such as these, whose whole lives were passed in the midst
      of endless strife, men ever ready, and glorying in their readiness, to
      turn out against invading Southern bands, or to slip over Carterfell into
      Redesdale to plunder those same Southrons, how could Ringan fail to be,
      what he was, a born fighter! With his enormous frame, immense personal
      strength, and dauntless courage, there was none in the Border so famed as
      he. Endless were the tales told of him,&mdash;how he could take "a ten
      half-fou boll of barley in the wield of his arm and fling it across a
      horse's back with the utmost ease"; how in his youth he raided Newcastle
      Jail, and rescued two of his friends, who had been, as he thought,
      unjustly imprisoned therein. The stories of him are endless. <span
      class="pagenum">137</span><a name="link137" id="link137"></a>Ringan lived
      in the stirring times of the Covenant, and with a disposition such as his,
      dourly religious, it is almost needless to say that he was prominent among
      the more militant section of the Covenanters of the seventeenth century.
      He was probably present at Drumclog, and he was certainly present at Both
      well Brig, in 1679, fighting as few fought that bloody day. His home was
      in caves and among rocks, beneath dripping peat-hags, and in holes in the
      ground, for many a day after this, but in 1680 he joined the outlawed Hall
      of Haughhead, and was in the tussle when that Champion of the Covenant was
      taken at Queensferry what time "those two bloody hounds the Curates of
      Borrowstonness and Carriden smelled out Mr. Cargill and his companion."
      Hall was killed, or at least died of his wounds before he could be brought
      to Edinburgh; but Ringan Oliver and "worthy Mr. Cargill" escaped the net
      of the fowler. Then, in 1689, he was with Mackay at Killicrankie; and the
      following day though exhausted with the precipitate flight from the
      battlefield, he fought at Dunkeld his famous duel with the Highland
      champion, Rory Dhu Mhor, whom he slew after a most desperate and bloody
      fight. Bleeding from half a score of wounds, Ringan had been beaten to his
      knees, and the affair seemed a certain victory for the Highlander. But the
      latter was over-confident; he thought he had a beaten man at his mercy,
      and one instant's carelessness gave Ringan his chance. Before his
      adversary could recover, the point of the Borderer's sword was out between
      the Highlander's shoulders, and with a roar of astonishment and wrath he
      fell dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps it was for the siege he stood at Smailcleuchfoot when he was
      now an old man, that Ringan is best remembered. After a stormy youth and
      middle age, he had at length settled down in his ancestral home, where he
      was leading the quiet life of a farmer. As the story is told, it seems
      that Ringan's strict integrity and high sense of honour had gained for him
      the respect and friendship of his powerful neighbour at Fernibirst&mdash;probably
      either the first or the second Marquess of <span class="pagenum">138</span><a
      name="link138" id="link138"></a>Lothian. Perhaps, too, there may have been
      something in the mutual belief and manner of thought of the two men that
      drew them together. (There was a Ker of about that date, or a little
      earlier, who was a zealous Covenanter.) In any case, the friendship was of
      such a nature that when Lord Lothian found himself, towards the close of
      his life, compelled to undertake what was then the long and trying journey
      to London, he left Ringan in charge of his private papers, and entrusted
      him with the key of a locked room in which valuable documents were kept,
      and into which he desired that no one should be permitted to enter whilst
      he himself was absent in the south. As it chanced, after Lord Lothian had
      started on his journey, his heir, considering, as a matter of course
      perhaps, that the old lord's prohibition did not apply to him, sent to
      Ringan demanding the key of the room, into which he had, or said he had,
      occasion to go. Ringan naturally, but perhaps not very deferentially or
      even politely, refused to give it up. Thereupon arose hot words, and
      bitter enmity on the part at least of the younger man, who, with that
      rather irrational form of vanity not uncommon in youth, imagined himself
      to be slighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And hence came serious consequences to the old Covenanter. For the
      Marquess died, and the man whom Ringan had offended succeeded to the title
      and estates. He had always&mdash;so the story goes&mdash;nursed his wrath
      to keep it warm, and he might be depended on to pay off, with interest,
      all old scores against him whom he talked of as that "dour old Cameronian
      devil." So it happened one day, towards the time of harvest, when corn lay
      waiting for the sickle in the smiling haughs of Jed, the young lord and
      his friends, attended by servants in charge of several dogs, came on
      horseback across the river and began to ride up and down through Ringan's
      crop, ostensibly looking for hares. The old man remonstrated in vain; no
      heed was paid to him, and at length, goaded to fury as he saw the havoc
      being played among his good oates and bere, he snatched up an old musket
      (that perhaps had seen service at Bothwell Brig) <span class="pagenum">139</span><a
      name="link139" id="link139"></a>and shot one of the dogs dead. That was
      enough; the old man had put himself now in the wrong. For the Marquess
      could plead that, after all, he had only been riding on his own land; and
      he and his friends could assert that the harm they had done, if any, had
      been infinitesimal. So the young lord rode off to Jedburgh, and had a
      summons issued by the Sheriff against Ringan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one thing, however, to issue the summons, quite another to serve
      it, or afterwards to get Ringan to obey the call. If he persisted in
      ignoring the summons, there were not many to be found bold enough to go to
      Smailcleuehfoot for the purpose of haling him before the Court; old as he
      now was, Ringan's reputation for strength and courage, and for reckless
      daring, was still great enough to keep the wolves of the law at bay.
      "But," said the Sheriff, "the law cannot thus be flouted; if he does not
      come willingly, then he must be <i>made</i> to come." Which of course was
      quite the right thing to say, especially if he had at hand the force
      necessary to carry out his threat. But that was where the difficulty came
      in. Finally, the Sheriff had to go himself to arrest old Ringan,
      impressing on his way everybody whom he could find capable of helping,
      including the Marquess himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ringan was warned of their coming, and advised to fly. "No!" said the old
      man. "I've dune no wrong. Let them touch me wha daur!" But he set about
      barricading his house, and when the Sheriff and his parry came on the
      scene they found a building with doors fast and windows shuttered, and no
      one visible. At their knock, Ringan appeared at a small upper window, but
      entirely declined to be taken, or to open the door. Then commenced a
      vigorous assault by the Sheriff and his party. They attempted to break in
      the door and to rush the building. Ringan opened fire on them with his old
      musket, and drove them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then for a time there occurred nothing more than a fruitless exchange
      of shots, as one or other of the Sheriff's <span class="pagenum">140</span><a
      name="link140" id="link140"></a>men left cover or Ringan showed himself at
      one of the windows. It appears, however, that there was in the house with
      the old man a young girl, either his adopted daughter or a domestic who
      looked after household affairs. This girl had been told to keep out of
      harm's way, to shelter in a "press" or cupboard well out of any possible
      range of bullet; but in the heat of battle the old man did not notice that
      curiosity had drawn her from the safety of this hiding place, and had
      brought her right behind him at the moment that he fired a shot through
      the window. It was a good shot, for it clipped away a curl from the
      Sheriff's wig, and perhaps in his satisfaction at going so near to his
      mark the old man may have showed himself a little too openly. Anyhow, at
      that moment two or three muskets replied, the heavy bullets coming with
      sullen "phut" into the woodwork of the little window-frame. But one flew
      straighter than the others; Ringan heard behind him a sound, half gasp,
      half sob, and turned just in time to see the lass sink on the floor, blood
      pouring from her throat. The old man tried to stanch the wound, but it
      needed hardly more than a glance to tell that it was far beyond his simple
      skill, and that she was past hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lust of battle seized him, blind fury filled his breast, and he
      thought only of revenge. He forgot his age, forgot that his fighting days
      should have been long over, forgot everything but the mad desire to clutch
      the throats of his foes and to choke the life out of them. So, tearing
      down the barricades of his door, he rushed out on his enemies like a wild
      bull charging. But alas for Ringan! part of the discarded barricade caught
      his foot as he burst over the threshold, and down he came with a crash.
      Before he could struggle even to his knees, the enemy was on him, and he
      was down again on his face, half a dozen men swarming over him. Even yet,
      however, old and hopelessly outnumbered as he was, the fight for a time
      was not so very unequal, and he might in the end have cast off the crowd
      that strove to hold and bind him. <span class="pagenum">141</span><a
      name="link141" id="link141"></a>An ill day it would have been for some of
      them had he succeeded. But a treacherous pedlar, who had joined the fray
      for the sake of hire, watching his chance, came behind, and with a blow
      from a hammer smashed Ringan's jaw and brought him to the ground, stunned.
      The old man was taken then, bound hand and foot, and carted off to
      Edinburgh. There, in the foul air of the Tolbooth he lay for eight weary
      years, suffering tortures great part of the time, not only from the broken
      jaw, but from old wounds which had broken out afresh, and which from the
      insanitary condition of the prison now refused to heal. It was a broken,
      frail old man who came out from that long imprisonment. And he never got
      back to his beloved Jed. Ringan Oliver died in Edinburgh in 1736; his huge
      frame sleeps in Greyfriars Churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one travels up Jed by the old coach road&mdash;whose windings do not
      invariably desert even the abruptest elbow of the stream&mdash;road and
      river finally part company at the bridge below Camptown. Here the latter's
      course swings gradually to the right, through leafy banks and under
      spreading trees, whilst the former, following a straighter route, enters
      on a long, steady bit of collar-work up the side of a pine-clad brae
      where, on one hand, lies the old camp from which the adjacent little
      settlement derives its name, and, on the other, Edgerston, sleeping in its
      woods. Here once stood Edgerston Castle, which Hertford's men took "by
      pollicie" in 1544;&mdash;someone sold the Rutherfurd of that day. Castle
      and lands then belonged to the Rutherfurds, one of the most ancient
      families in Scotland, and still the lands are theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little way past Edgerston the road begins its long two mile climb to an
      elevation of close on 1500 feet near the summit of Catcleuch Shin. There,
      immediately after passing the Carter Bar, it crosses the Border line, and
      drops steadily down into Redesdale, past the new Catcleuch Reservoir that
      supplies Newcastle with water, a work which has wiped out of existence one
      of the pleasantest bits of fishing in the kingdom, where trout were many
      and game, and of enviable size. <span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a>Perhaps the trout are there still&mdash;for
      those who may take them&mdash;but the capture of a dozen fish in still
      water cannot match the joy experienced in fighting one good Rede trout in
      the strong rushing stream where he has passed all his days.

      Beyond the Catcleuch Reservoir, a road of easy gradients sweeps down the
      delightful Rede valley, past innumerable old camps, British and Roman;
      past Rowchester, into whose little school house, that stands solitary in
      the angle of two ways, are built numerous stones (carved and otherwise)
      handily quarried from the adjacent old Roman station of Bremenium; and
      high up, on the roof of the building, from the same source are various
      large round stone balls that may have formed part of the ammunition for a
      Roman ballista. It was this route that the Roman legions followed over the
      Cheviots in their northward march from the mighty wall they had stretched
      across England from sea to sea. A few miles east from Catcleuch Shin,
      their military road bursts suddenly into view of that glorious sweep of
      country where the triple-peaked Eildons dominate the scene, a landmark
      that no doubt led them first to the site of their famous Newstead camp.
      <span class="pagenum">143</span><a name="link143" id="link143"></a>In
      early nineteenth century days, when His Majesty's mail coaches between
      Newcastle and Edinburgh came jangling over the crest of this bleak,
      unprotected bit of road at Catcleueh Shin, taking at a gallant trot the
      long, stiff gradient that faced them whether they were heading to the
      south or to the north, the trials of outside passengers in winter time
      must not seldom have been of a nature truly unenviable. Bitter sleet,
      driving before a westerly gale, lashed their faces and stole chill wet
      fingers inside their wraps and upturned collars; drifting, blinding snow,
      swirling on the wings of a wild north-easter, blurred the guiding line of
      snow-posts, and even at times hid his leaders from the coachman's sight,
      so that his first warning of being off the road and on the moor, was a
      heavy lurch as the coach buried its side in some blind hollow; frost, and
      a thermometer in the neighbourhood of zero, nipped from ears and nose and
      toes every vestige of feeling, and chilled to the very bone those whom
      duty or business forced to travel. It was truly a large assortment of
      evils that our ancestors had to choose from, in the winter, on that road
      over into England by the Carter Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if winter was bad, surely in the better time of year there were
      pleasures that atoned for all they had suffered. In the long twilight of a
      summer's evening, when moorland scents fill all the air and the crow of
      grouse echoes from the heathery knolls, what pleasure more satisfying
      could there be in life than to sit behind a free-going team of bays,
      listening lazily to the rhythm of the chiming hoofs, to the ring of steel
      bitts and the merry jingle of the splinter-bars? And as the coach breasted
      the summit, and began to make up time on the down gradient, the glorious
      view that broke on the eye of the north bound passenger of itself would
      make amends for halt the ills of life. Away to the west, stretched ever
      more dim in the fading sunset glow, the long-flung line of Cheviots&mdash;Carterfell,
      the Carlin's Tooth (where springs the infant Jed), Peel Fell, Hartshorn
      Pyke, all blending, far down, into the round green <span class="pagenum">144</span><a
      name="link144" id="link144"></a>hills of Liddesdale; then, more to the
      north-westward, set in the wide expanse, the Windburgh Hill and
      Cauldcleuch Head; farther off, away over the high land of upper
      Teviotdale,

    </p>
    <p>
      and the dim shapes of the mighty "Laws" of Peeblesshire&mdash;Broad Law,
      Dollar Law, Black Law. Then far below this vantage point on Catcleuch
      Shin, in middle foreground Edgerston's darkening woods; beyond, Ruberslaw,
      Minto Crags,&mdash;"where falcons hang their giddy nest,"&mdash;and the
      Dunion; then, to the right, Eildon's cloven peak, and, near-by, the Blac k
      Hill at Earlston, with the Lammermuirs in dimmest background; to the right
      again, Smailholme Tower, erect and watchful; east of that, the green
      Merse, wide-spread like a map, stretched almost to the sea, and on the
      extreme right, far off, Cheviot himself, blocking the view. What a truly
      magnificent sweep of country it is! A sense of space, and room to breathe,
      such as one finds seldom in this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hundred and thirty-eight years ago, however, there were Scots and
      English assembled on that Catcleuch ridge one summer's day, who had no
      eyes for the view;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "The seventh of July, the suith to say,

    <p class="indent20">

    <p class="indent15">

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As was customary, the English and Scottish Wardens of the Marches had met
      for the discussion and settlement of Border claims and disputes, and for
      the redressing of wrongs. Sir John Carmichael in this instance acted for
      Scotland, Sir John Forster for England. The former was accompanied by the
      young Scott of Buccleuch,&mdash;according to Sir Walter the same who,
      twenty-one years later, was famous for the rescue of Kinmont Willie from
      Carlisle Castle,&mdash;by sundry Armstrongs, <span class="pagenum">145</span><a
      name="link145" id="link145"></a>Elliots, Douglases, Turnbulls of Rule

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a turbulent band, one would think, and not easy of control.
      Forster had at his back Fenwicks&mdash;"five hundred Fenwicks in a flock,"
      says the ballad,&mdash;Shaftoes, Collingwoods, and other of the great
      English Border families, the men from Hexham and thereabout, and many of
      the fiercest fighters of Redesdale and Tynedale, the two latter said to be
      then the most lawless people of the North of England. Indeed, their
      reputation was so evil that the merchants of Newcastle passed a by-law in
      the year 1564 that no apprentices should be taken "proceeding from such
      leude and wicked progenitors."; Thus it may be seen that both nations were
      strongly represented, and that on both sides there was superabundance of
      most inflammable material waiting but for a spark to set it ablaze. In
      most promising and peaceful fashion, however, the proceedings opened:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Yett was our meeting meek eneugh;

    <p class="indent20">
      Some gaed to drink, and some stude still,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And all went smoothly and well, till the case of one Robson, a notorious
      Redesdale horse and cattle-thief, came up for discussion. The Scottish
      warden, following the usual Border custom in such cases, demanded that the
      culprit, having been guilty of theft on the northern side of the March,
      should be given into Scottish custody till such time as reparation be made
      to the parties robbed by the Redesdale man. Sir John Forster demurred,
      giving as his reason for evading the usual practice in such cases, that
      Robson had fled and could not be captured. "Oh! Play fair!" cried
      Carmichael contemptuously. Whereupon Forster not unnaturally lost his
      temper, and made a fierce and insulting reply. Hot words leapt from angry
      lips, and <span class="pagenum">146</span><a name="link146" id="link146"></a>swords,
      which in those days were never long idle, began to flash in the warm
      sunshine as they left the scabbards. And then the Tynedale men&mdash;"Fy,
      Tyndale, to it!"&mdash;eager to take time by the forelock, and determined
      not to stand out of what fray might be going, loosed off a flight of
      arrows among the Scots. And all the fat was in the fire. Like fiercest
      wolves, the two sides flew at each other's throats, trampling over the
      heathery ground, cursing, slashing, stabbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scots at first were getting rather the worst of the affray; Carmichael
      was down, and a prisoner; others were disabled. The English had the slope
      of the hill slightly in their favour and made the most of their advantage,
      gradually forcing their foes to fall back in tardy and sullen retreat.
      Then came to the hot headed Tynedale men the irresistible temptation to
      plunder. It was customary at those Wardens' Meetings for pedlars or small
      tradesmen to erect on the ground selected for the meeting, tents, or, as
      we say in Scotland, "crames," sort of temporary shop-counters sheltered by
      canvas, in or on which they displayed the wares they had for sale. So it
      had been at this Reidswire Meeting. And as the Scots were forced back past
      those "crames," the desire for loot proved too strong for some of the
      English combatants. By ones and twos, as opportunity offered, they edged
      away from the fight, and, like marauding wasps to crop of ripe plums, made
      for this booty that might be had for the taking. Fighting and plunder were
      equally congenial to the men of Tynedale.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that very moment, however, in which a large number had so withdrawn
      themselves, unfortunately for them reinforcements arrived for the Scots.
      "Jethart's here!" rang out over the roar and stress of the fight, and into
      the "tulzie" plunged the men of Jedburgh, hot off their ten mile march.

    <p class="indent15">
      "Bauld Rutherfurd, he was fou stout,

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">147</span><a name="link147" id="link147"></a>The
      tables were badly turned on the English; now they in turn began to give
      way, and to be forced back up the hill down which till now they had been
      successfully pressing the Scots. Too late the Tynedale men tried to
      retrieve their error; the Scots got them on the run and gave no breathing
      space; speedily the run became a rout. Over the crest into Redesdale fled
      the discomfited English, dropping here a man, there a man, as they fled.
      "Sir George Hearoune of Schipsydehouse," (Sir George Heron Miles of
      Chipchase Castle,) fell early in the fight, and four and twenty dead
      bowmen kept him company. The wounded on both sides were many; and among
      the prisoners taken by the Scots were the English Warden, Sir James Ogle,
      Sir Cuthbert Collingwood, Sir Francis Russell (son of the Earl of
      Bedford), several Fenwicks, and other leading men from the English side of
      the Border. Carmichael took his prisoners to Edinburgh&mdash;not greatly
      to the comfort of the Scottish Regent, the Earl of Morton; for England and
      Scotland were then, for once in a way, at peace, and such an incident as
      this Raid of the Reidswire was but too likely to result in further war
      between the nations. Therefore, after a day or two's detention, or rather,
      perhaps, after a day or two's entertainment, Morton, with every expression
      of regret and of regard, sent all the prisoners back to England,
      apparently not ill pleased with their treatment. No international
      complications followed the affair. Carmichael was sent to York to explain
      matters, and he seems to have been able to show satisfactorily that the
      Scots were within their rights throughout; that, in fact, as the ballad
      says:

    <p>
      Some years ago, a very handsome silver mounted sword, and a fine specimen
      of a dagger, were unearthed by a man employed in cutting drains on the
      hillside where the battle was fought that July day of 1575. The sword was
      a beautiful <span class="pagenum">148</span><a name="link148" id="link148"></a>weapon,
      of fine temper, and it probably belonged to one of the English leaders.
      Unfortunately it has been lost. Both it and the dagger have, as I
      understand, mysteriously disappeared from the house in which they were
      kept. Somebody too greatly admired them, one may suppose, and followed the
      example set by the men of Tynedale in the heat of battle that day.

      The scene of the fight is that fairly level bit of moorland to the left of
      the road just after you quit the Carter Bar, going south.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harking back now for a moment to Jed,&mdash;five or six miles above the
      bridge at Camptown where we quitted the line of river to follow the old
      coach road over Carter Fell, we come to Southdean. Here are the ruins of
      an ancient church, (the foundations, at least, and part of the walls and
      tower,) which have lately been dug out from the great green mound with its
      big ash trees atop, which lay these two hundred years and more between
      hillside and river, down by the little grey <span class="pagenum">149</span><a
      name="link149" id="link149"></a>bridge. This is the "churche in a fayre
      launde called Zedon," wherein, says Froissart, Douglas and the other
      Scottish leaders met on the eve of that expedition into England which
      ended with the glorious fight of Otterbourne. "I never heard the old song
      of Percy and Douglas," wrote Sir Philip Sidney, "that I found not my heart
      more moved than with a trumpet;" and who is there to-day, in spite of
      lapse of centuries, whose blood does not quicken at the very sound of the
      word "Otterbourne."
    </p>
    <p>
      It used to be said that the "Zedon" of Froissart was more applicable to
      Yetholm than to Southdean. Some, indeed, still maintain that, as far at
      least as <i>sound</i> is concerned, "Zedon" (the "Z", as was formerly not
      uncommon, being treated as a "Y") bears a much greater resemblance to
      "Yethoim" than to "Southdean." One may readily admit that as it is
      spelled, "South-dean" is not in the least like "Zedon." But it is an
      entirely different affair when we come to a matter of local pronunciation.
      In this case the pronunciation is, as near as may be, "Seuden." If we very
      slightly soften the sound of the letter "Z," and allow for the fact that
      the "e" of Zedon would naturally be used by Froissart with the same value
      that it bears in his own language, we arrive absolutely at the local
      pronunciation of the name&mdash;"Seuden."
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, it seems most unlikely that the point of assembly could have
      been Yetholm, if only for the reason that when marching from there into
      England,&mdash;presumably by way of the Bowmont valley, and so past Wooler
      and through Northumberland,&mdash;Douglas would have exposed himself to be
      struck in rear and on his left flank from the adjacent vantage points of
      Roxburgh and Wark, both of which formidable strongholds were then in
      English hands, and, (seeing that the intention of the Scots to make an
      invasion had long been known in Northumberland,) probably held in force.
      And certainly, if the column came by way of Ottercops and Rothely Crags,
      as it is said to have done, its starting point was not <span
      class="pagenum">150</span><a name="link150" id="link150"></a>Yetholm.
      Obviously, too, a Scottish army concentrated at Southdean was in a much
      better strategical position than any that it could have occupied in the
      neighbourhood of Yetholm. From Southdean it could strike either way at
      will, either over the easy, and necessarily well known, pass by Catcleuch
      Shin, or across the hills by the old Roman way, the Whele Causeway, into
      Liddesdale, and thence on to Carlisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Scottish plan, to assemble an army here at Southdean, was the outcome
      of a meeting held some time previously at Aberdeen, a city "on the fronter
      of the Wylde Scottes," and, so far as was possible, the business had been
      kept secret; even to the King himself no hint was given of what the Nobles
      designed, "for," said they among themselves, "the King is no manne of
      warre." But "the Scottes coude nat do their maters so secretly, but the
      lords of Englande knewe howe men rose in Scotland, and how they shulde
      mete agayne at Gedeours." Spies brought word to Northumberland of what was
      afoot, and the English took all necessary steps to upset the Scottish plan
      of campaign. If the Scots decided to come by way of Carlisle, then the
      English resolved that they, on their part, would burst into Scotland by
      way of Berwick, or by Dunbar. Thus, said they, "we shall do them more
      dommage than they can do us, for their countrey is all open; we maye go
      where we lyst, and our countre is strong, and the townes and castelles
      well closed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Scots had gathered at Southdean this August of 1388 so vast an
      army that "in threscore yere before there was nat assembled toguyder in
      Scotlande suche a nombre of good men; there were xii hundred speares and
      xl thousande men besvde with their archers; but in tyme of nede the
      Scottes can lytell skyll with their bowes; they rather beare axes,
      wherwith they gyve great strokes." And this army, "whan they were thus
      mette togyder in the marchesse of Gedours.... were mery, and sayd, they
      wolde never entre againe into their owne houses tyll they had ben in
      Englande, and done suche dedes there that it shulde be spoken of xx yere
      after." <span class="pagenum">151</span><a name="link151" id="link151"></a>To
      this gathering at Southdean came an English spy, one who "knewe right well
      the marchesse of Scotlande, and specially the forest of Gedeours." Without
      arousing suspicion, this man made his way into the church, and overheard
      the Scottish leaders discuss their plans. And when he had picked up
      information enough for his purpose, he withdrew quietly from the building
      and went to get his horse, which he had left in a convenient spot, tied to
      a tree. But never a trace of horse nor of harness was there now, "for a
      Scotte, who be great theves, had stollen hym awaye." It was a very tight
      corner for the spy. He durst make no great outcry, lest he betray himself;
      so, in default, he started "forthe afote, boted and spurred," thinking
      maybe to slip out of the camp unobserved and make over the Cheviots into
      Rede valley. In any other place but the Border, perhaps he might have got
      clear away. But the Borderers have ever been horse lovers, and now the
      unwonted sight of a man, booted and spurred, footing it, at once drew eyes
      to him that might have taken little heed had he been mounted. "A filthie
      thing," says Bishop Leslie, writing of the Borderers in the sixteenth
      century, "a filthie thing thay estcime it, and a verie abjecte man thay
      halde him that gangis upon his fete, ony voyage. Quhairthrough cumis that
      al are horsmen." So the spy had not gone many furlongs ere he was stopped
      by two mounted men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Felowe," said one of the two to the other, "I have sene a marveyle;
      beholde yonder a man goeth alone, and as I thynke, he hath lost his horse,
      for he came by and spake no worde; I wene he be none of our company; lette
      us ryde after him to prove my saying." So, says Froissart, they went after
      him. And "whane he sawe them commynge, he wolde gladly have ben thens."
      The spy's answers to questions not being satisfactory, "they brought hym
      againe to the church of Zedon and presented him to the Erle Duglas and to
      other lordes." And there "they handled hym in suche wise that he was fayne
      to shewe all the mater." Their methods were not gentle in <span
      class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>those days;
      one wonders what they did. Anyhow, "they knew by hym that the lordes of
      Northumberland had sent hym thyder, to know the estate of their
      enterprise, and whiche waye they wolde drawe. Hereof the Scottes were
      right joyous, and wolde nat for a great good but that they had spoken with
      this squyer."

    <p>
      Scottish arguments proved too strong for the unhappy Englishman: "Sirs,"
      said he at last, "sithe it behoveth me to saye the truthe, I shall." So he
      gave information of the whereabouts of the English army, and disclosed the
      whole of the English plans, telling how, the force at the disposal of the
      Northumbrian lords not being strong enough to stand up against the
      Scottish host, the intention of the English leaders was that if the Scots
      should "take the waye into Gales [Cumberland] they wyll go by Berwike, and
      so to Dunbare, to Edinborowe, or els to Alquest [Dalkeith]; and if ye take
      nat that waye, then they wyll go by Carlyle, and into the mountayns of the
      countrey. Whan the lordes herde that, eche of them regarded other." As
      indeed they had excellent cause, for this information put into their hands
      a card that could most effectually trump their adversary's strongest suit.
      They were "ryght joyfull," says Froissart, and "demannded counsayle what
      way was best for them to take."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the main army was despatched over the hills, probably, and
      most naturally, up Jed and the Raven Burn, and across into Liddesdale by
      the old Roman road that leaves Carlin Tooth and Wheelrig Head on its left,
      and follows down Peel Burn to Liddel Water; thence down the Liddel Valley
      the marching would be easy to Longtown and on to Carlisle; whilst Douglas,
      with a flying column consisting of "thre hundred speares of chosen men,
      and of two thousande other men and archers," went up the Carter Burn and
      over the easy pass at Catcleuch Shin into Redesdale, with intent to "drawe
      towardes Newcastell upon Tyne, and passe the ryver and entre into the
      bysshoprike of Durham, and burne and exyle the country." <span
      class="pagenum">153</span><a name="link153" id="link153"></a>"Thus these
      two hoostes departed eche from other, echo of them prayenge other, that if
      the Englysshmen folowed any of their armyes, nat to fyght with them tyll
      bothe their armyes were joyned toguyder. Thus in a mornyng they departed
      fro Gedeours, and toke the feldes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the Rede valley&mdash;all fairly easy going in the dry August
      weather, even at that day, one may suppose; Froissart says the weather was
      "fayre and temperate,"&mdash;and across Tyne, Douglas pushed rapidly,
      pausing neither to burn nor to slay, until he came into Durham, "where
      they founde a good countrey. Than they beganne to make warre, to slee
      people, and to brinne vyllages, and to do many sore displeasures."
      Everyone knows what happened after this; how at length, having skirmished
      right up to the walls of Durham, and beyond, Douglas and his men turned
      again northward and halted two days before Newcastle, where lay Percy, and
      English knights so many that "they wyst not where to lodge"; how, wjilst
      the Scots remained here, Douglas and Percy fought, and Douglas overthrew
      Percy and took from him a trophy which the latter swore to redeem before
      it could be carried from Northumberland; and how Percy, coming up with the
      Scots at Otterburne, strove to regain that which he had lost at Newcastle,
      and was defeated and made prisoner; how the fight raged throughout the
      moon lit night far into the morning, and the trampled heath lay red with
      more than the bloom of heather; and how Earl Douglas was slain. It is all
      told in the ballad, and how valiantly each fought where cowards had no
      place.

      With hand to hand fighting so close and so fierce as here befell at

      Godscroft, the English alone lost one thousand eight hundred and forty
      killed, and over a thousand wounded. The total Scottish loss in killed,
      wounded and missing appears to have been less than half that of the enemy
      in killed alone. The English lost also over a thousand men who were
      captured by the Scots; indeed, the latter had so many prisoners that they
      were greatly put to it to know what to do with them at the moment when the
      Bishop of Durham with his ten thousand fresh troops came on the scene and
      seemed likely to renew the battle. Many of the prisoners were men of
      distinction. Percy himself was taken by the Earl of Montgomery; his
      brother, Ralph Percy, by Sir John Maxwell; Sir Matthew Reedman, governor
      of Berwick, by Sir James Lindsay. And many another Scottish knight or
      squire held his brother of England to ransom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Froissart describes more than one picturesque incident of the fight, and
      none, surely, is more vivid and alive than that in which he tells how Sir
      Matthew Reedman, Governor of Berwick, fled From the field, pursued by Sir
      James Lindsay. When all was done that man could do, and all was done in
      vain, Sit Matthew turned to save himself. Lindsay chanced to be near at
      hand, and saw him gallop out from the stress of battle. "And this Sir
      James to wyn honour, followed in chase.... and came so nere hym that he
      myght have stryken him with his speare if he had lyst. Than he said, 'Ah,
      sir knyght, tourne, it is a shame thus to flye: I am James of Lindsay: if
      ye wyll nat tourne I shall stryke you on the backe <span class="pagenum">159</span><a
      name="link159" id="link159"></a>with my speare.' Sir Matthew spake no
      worde, but strake his horse with the spurrs sorer than he dyde before. In
      this manner he chased hym more than thre myles, and at lasts sir Mathue
      Reedman's horse foundred and fell under hym. Than he stept forth on the
      erthe, and drewe oute hys swerde, and toke corage to defende hymselfe; and
      the Scotte thought to have stryken hym on the brest, but sir Mathewe
      Reedman swerved fro the stroke, and the speare poynt entered into the
      erthe: than sir Mathue strake asonder the speare with his swerde. And whan
      sir James Lynsay sawe howe he had loste his speare, he caste awaye the
      trounchon and lyghted afote, and toke a lytell batayle axe that he caryed
      at his backe, and handeled it with his one hande, quiekely and delyverly,
      in the whiche feate Scottes be well experte. And than he sette at sir
      Mathue, and he defended hymselfe properly. Thus they tourneyed toguyder,
      one with an axe, and the other with a swerde, a longe season, and no man
      to lette them. Fynally, sir James Lynsay gave the knyght suche strokes,
      and helde hym so shorte, that he was putte out of brethe, in such wyse
      that he yelded hymselfe, and sayde: 'Sir James Lynsay, I yelde me to you.'
      'Well,' quod he, 'and I receyve you, rescue or no rescue.' 'I am content,'
      quod Reedman, 'so ye deale with me lyke a good campanyon.' 'I shall not
      fayle that,' quod Lynsay, and so put up his swerde. 'Well, sir,' quod
      Reedman, 'what wyll you nowe that I shall do? I am your prisoner, ye have
      conquered me; I wolde gladly go agayn to Newcastell, and within fyftene
      dayes I shall come to you into Scotlande, where as ye shall assigne me.'
      'I am content,' quod Lynsay: 'ye shall promyse by your faythe to present
      yourselfe within this iii wekes at Edenborowe, and wheresoever ye go, to
      repute yourself my prisoner.' All this sir Mathue sware and promysed to
      fulfyll. Than eche of them toke their horses and toke leave eche of
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to meet again, however, in less than the stipulated time. Sir
      James turned his horse towards Otterburne, <span class="pagenum">160</span><a
      name="link160" id="link160"></a>intent on rejoining his friends. But a
      mist came down over the hills and blotted out the moorland; he could only
      feel his way in the direction he desired to go. And when at length through
      the haar and thickness there came to his ears the muffled sound of voices,
      the ring of bridles and snort of horses, in full assurance that the sounds
      came from a body of his own men returning from pursuit of the broken
      English, he rode confidently forward, it was to find himself face to face
      with five hundred horse under the Bishop of Durham. And said the Bishop to
      Lindsay: "'Ye shall go with me to Newcastell.' 'I may nat chose,' quod
      Lynsay, 'sithe ye wyll have it so; I have taken, and I am taken, suche is
      the adventures of armes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whom have ye taken': quod the bysshop. 'Sir,' quod he, 'I toke in the
      chase sir Malhue Redman.' 'And where is he?' quod the bysshop. 'By my
      faythe, sir, he is returned to Newcastell; he desyred me to trust hym on
      his faythe for thre wekes, and so have I done.' 'Well,' quod the bysshop,
      'lette us go to New castell, and there ye shall speke wyth hym.' Thus they
      rode to Newcastell toguyder, and sir James Lynsay was prisoner to the
      Bysshop of Durham." So the twain met again, and "'By my faythe, sir
      Mathewe,' said Lindsay, 'I beleve ye shall nat nede to come to Edenborowe
      to me to make your fynaunce: I thynke rather we shall make an exchaunge
      one for another, if the bysshoppe be so contente.'" Whereupon, Reedman&mdash;-as
      has ever been the wont of Englishmen&mdash;proposed that they should mark
      the occasion by a dinner; and, says Froissart, "thus these two knyghts
      dyned toguyder in Newcastell."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a valiant person, apparently, this Bishop of Durham. Had he
      been a very militant Prince of the Church, it had surely gone hard now
      with the Scots, for, outnumbered as they had been throughout the fight,
      they were sore spent ere ever the Bishop hove in sight with his ten
      thousand fresh troops, and it could scarcely have taken very much to drive
      them from the field in headlong rout. But the English leader was not a
      very intrepid man; and when he found the Scots <span class="pagenum">161</span><a
      name="link161" id="link161"></a>drawn together in a position so defended
      by swamp and morass that entry could be forced only by the one way, the
      Bishop hesitated. Then the Scottish leaders ordered their "mynstrels to
      blowe up all at ones, and make the greatest revell of the worlde"; for, as
      Froissart says, "whan they blowe all at ones, they make suche a noyse that
      it may be herde nighe iiii myles of; thus they do to abasshe their
      enemyes, and to rejoyse themselfes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The instruments used were horns, we are told. Had they been bagpipes, one
      might perhaps have understood the consternation of the English. Says
      Froissart: "Whan the bysshoppe of Durham, with his baner, and XM men with
      hym, were aproched within a leage, than the Scottes blew their homes in
      suche wise that it seemed that all the devyls in hell had been amonge
      them, so that such as herde them, and knewe nat of their usage, were sore
      abasshed." Nevertheless, the Bishop, with his host in order of battle,
      advanced to within about two bow-shot of the Scots, and there came to a
      halt in order to reconnoitre their position. The more he looked at it, the
      less he liked it; losses were certain to be heavy, victory by no means
      assured. So the English drew off; and the Scots, we are told, "wente to
      their lodgynges and made mery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the next day, having burned their camp, they marched unmolested back
      up the Rede valley into Scotland; and with them they bore the honoured
      bodies of Douglas and of others who had fallen in the fight. Percy went
      with them, a captive, and many another distinguished Englishman against
      his will sadly followed the victors. But those prisoners who were too
      badly hurt to endure the march into Scotland were sent under parole back
      to Newcastle, among them Sir Ralph Percy, who was returned in a horse
      litter. Huge sums are mentioned as having been paid in ransom by the
      English prisoners, the estimate of some writers reaching the extravagant
      figure of £600,000, a sum that in those days would have enriched the
      entire Scottish nation beyond the dreams of avarice. Even that number of
      pounds <span class="pagenum">162</span><a name="link162" id="link162"></a>Scots
      (equal to £50,000) seems beyond reason. Froissart's 200,000 francs (£8,000
      in our money) is probably about what was paid&mdash;in that day a most
      handsome sum.

      A cheerful little village is the Otterburne of the present day,&mdash;even
      though there are not wanting evidences that some part of it, down by the
      inn, for example,-has planted itself in too close proximity to a river and
      a burn which still, as in those early eighteenth century days of "Mad"
      Jack Hall, are capable of sudden and vindictive flood. As regards the
      battlefield, however, there is not a great deal to see. The so-called
      Percy's Cross, which stands in a thin clump of trees to the east of the
      road three-quarters of a mile on the Scottish side of the village, is a
      comparatively modern erection. The true site ot the original "Battle
      Stone," according to maps of date 1769, was about a couple of hundred
      yards more to the east, and there it stood, or rather, lay, till 1777,
      when the then proprietor of the land, a <span class="pagenum">163</span><a
      name="link163" id="link163"></a>Mr. Ellison, put up the cross now
      standing, within view of the new turnpike road which was then being made
      up the valley of the Rede. Mr. Ellison used the ancient socket of the
      original cross, but the rough pedestal on which the socket stands has
      nothing to do with the old memorial.

      Nor has the present shaft, which, says Mr. Robert White in his "History of
      the Battle of Otterburne" (1857), was nothing but "an old architrave which
      had been removed from the kitchen fireplace at Otterburne Hall. This
      stone, the cross-section of which is fifteen and a half by eight inches,
      still shows a bevelled corner throughout its length; besides, two small
      pieces of iron project from one of its sides, which, in its former period
      of usefulness, were probably connected with some culinary apparatus. On
      its top is another stone, tapering to a point, which completes the
      erection. The entire length of the shaft above the base is nine and a half
      feet. The socket is a worn, weather-beaten <span class="pagenum">164</span><a
      name="link164" id="link164"></a>sandstone, about two feet square, without
      any tool-marks upon it, and appears to have been in use much longer than
      any of the stones connected with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A still more modern memorial of the battle is a large semicircular seat
      cut in freestone, bearing on darker coloured panels various inscriptions,
      which stands by the road-side a little farther to the north. This was
      erected in 1888 by Mr. W. H. James, then M.P. for Gateshead. It may be
      noted that one of the panels gives the date of the battle as <i>tenth</i>
      August, 1388, which is almost certainly a mistake.

    <p>
      Douglas, of course, had satisfactory reasons for camping that night where
      he did,&mdash;reasons not unconnected probably with the question of
      shelter from English arrows. A wood protected him, it is said. Had he gone
      four or five miles farther on up the valley, he might have occupied the
      old Roman camp of Bremenium, a strong position, not sheltered from
      arrow-flight by trees, it is true, but protected on two sides by what in
      old days must have been swamps, and surrounded by a heavy wall which, even
      in its present condition, would be, to a defending force, a considerable
      protection in hand to hand fighting. Five hundred years ago, before the
      day of agricultural improvement and the custom of using ancient monuments
      as a quarry, such a defence must have made the camp a place of very
      considerable strength. Portions only now remain of the formidable wall
      which originally protected Bremenium, but enough stands to show what its
      strength must have been in the days when the Roman Legions manned it. The
      face is composed of great blocks of hewn freestone, accurately fitted; in
      height it must have been about fourteen feet, in thickness something like
      seventeen,&mdash;the inner portion, of course, being rubble work; outside
      there were two or more fosses. One of the gateways is still intact to a
      very considerable height, but the camp as a whole has to a most pitiable
      extent been used as a quarry, perhaps for hundreds of years. Even yet, one
      doubts if it is held quite sacred from vandal raids. As late as 1881, when
      <span class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165" id="link165"></a>members
      of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club visited the camp they found masons
      deliberately quarrying stones from one corner of the wall, in order to
      build a hideous modern cottage, and I daresay some of the houses in the
      immediate neighbourhood may be composed entirely of stones taken from the
      old walls. The writer has not seen the Roman tombs which exist about half
      a mile to the east of the camp. The largest of these is said to have still
      two courses of stones standing, besides the flat stones of the foundation.
      This tomb has in front a small carving, regarding which Dr. Collingwood
      Bruce, in "The Roman Wall," suggests that it may have been intended to
      represent "the head of a boar&mdash;the emblem of the twentieth legion."
      The writer is given to understand that the carving bears no resemblance
      whatever to the head of a boar. A coin of the Emperor Alexander Severus
      was found in this tomb, together with a jar containing calcined bones, and
      a coin of the Emperor Trajan was found in the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many of Douglas's wounded, one wonders, were carried from the field of
      battle over to Southdean, and, succumbing there to their wounds, were
      buried at the church? Two or three years ago, when the ash-trees were cut
      down and the grassy mound carted away that had so long concealed the ruins
      of the old building, quantities of human bones were dug up within and
      about the walls, some of the skulls showing unmistakably that the owners
      had died no peaceful death. No doubt the main body of the Scottish army
      would follow the dead Douglas to his tomb in Melrose Abbey, and would
      therefore never come so far west as Southdean, but the severely wounded
      would naturally be left wherever they could be attended to. It is certain
      that the Southdean district was in old days much less sparsely populated
      than is now the case; two important yearly fairs, for instance, used
      formerly to be held at Lethem, (three miles nearer the Border than
      Southdean,)&mdash;where also, on a knoll still called the Chapel Knowe,
      was a chapel, subsidiary to the church of Southdean. These fairs were for
      the sale of <span class="pagenum">166</span><a name="link166" id="link166"></a>"horse,
      nolt, sheep, fish, flesh, malt, meal," and all sorts of merchandise, and
      in the permit to hold the Fairs Lethem is described as being "by reason of
      its situation, lying near the Border, a very convenient and fit place for
      traffic and trade."

      The church of Southdean, therefore, as its ruins indicate, was probably of
      considerable importance, surrounded by a settlement of some size, where
      wounded men might well be left to take their chance of recovery. Whether
      the Scots returned from Otterburne up Rede valley and over the pass by way
      of Catcleuch Shin, or (as is more probable) followed the Roman Road which
      passes Bremeirum Camp and runs over the Cheviots some miles to the east of
      Carter-fell, and thence crossing Kale, Oxnam, Jed, and Teviot, goes in
      more or less direct line towards Newstead and Melrose, it would be easy
      and natural for them to detach a party with the wounded, and perhaps with
      the bodies of some of the more notable dead, to <span class="pagenum">167</span><a
      name="link167" id="link167"></a>Southdean. And those of them who died
      there would of course be buried in or close to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the excavations, it is of interest to note that numbers of skulls
      were found all together at one spot, pointing to the probability of many
      bodies having been, from some common cause, buried in a common grave. The
      inference seems not illegitimate that this cause was the fight at
      Otterburne. The English appear to have carried away from the field many of
      their dead, as well as their wounded:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Then on the morne they mayde them beerys

      Ther makes they fette awaye."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not unlikely that the Scots also brought away some, at least, of
      their dead, and, as Southdean was the nearest spot in their own country
      where they could find consecrated ground, the probability is that these
      bodies, as well as those of the wounded who died later, would find rest
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his "History and Poetry of the Scottish Border," Professor Veitch
      mentions that "a recent discovery made at Elsdon Church, about three miles
      from the scene of conflict, may be regarded as throwing some light on the
      slaughter. There skulls to the amount of a thousand have been disinterred,
      all lying together. They are of lads in their teens, and of middle-aged
      men; but there are no skulls of old men, or of women. Not improbably these
      are the dead of Otterburne."
    </p>
    <p>
      The length of the old building at Southdean, including tower and chancel,
      was ninety-seven feet, and the nave was about twenty-three feet in width.
      Many notable things were unearthed during the work of excavation, those of
      most interest possibly being a massive octagonal font, cut from one block
      of stone, and a small stone super-altar incised with the usual five
      crosses.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Southdean, as elsewhere, the old church has for generations been used
      as a quarry. The retaining wall of the adjacent <span class="pagenum">168</span><a
      name="link168" id="link168"></a>Newcastle road is full of dressed stones
      taken from the building, and others, some of them carved, have been built
      into the walls of an adjoining barn. Certainly our ancestors in this
      instance had more excuse than usual to offer for their depredations, for
      the building was a hopeless ruin. The roof of the church fell in one
      Sunday in the year 1689, and the walls&mdash;not unhelped by human hands&mdash;speedily
      followed suit. Stones from the principal doorway seem to have been used in
      1690 in the building of a new church at Chesters. That too is now in
      ruins.

      CHAPTER VI ALE, RULE WATER, TEVIOT, HAWICK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s we ascend
      Teviot, after Jed its next important tributary is the Ale, not so named
      from the resemblance of its waters, when flooded, to a refreshing
      beverage. Sir Herbert Maxwell says that the name was originally written
      "Alne" (as in Aln, Alnwick) and this form survives in the place-name in
      Ale, Ancrum, the site of a desirable Scottish victory. The word would at
      first be Alne crumb, the crook of Alne or "Ale." Crom does mean "crook" in
      Gaelic, I understand, and Ale does make a crook or bend round Ancrum, so
      the names are tokens of the possession of the dale by Gaelic-speaking
      people, very long ago. In Timpendean, the name of a ruined tower opposite
      the point where Ale enters Teviot, we have the English "dene" or "den," as
      in the neighbouring Hassendoan The places of most historical interest on
      lower Ale are Ancrum Moor and Lilliard's Edge, the scene of a battle in
      which the Scots partly avenged the incessant burnings and slayings by the
      men of Henry VIII, inflicted while the prince was furious at his failure
      to secure the hand of the baby Queen, Mary Stuart, for his puny son, later
      Edward VI. Henry first hoped, by the aid of these professional traitors,
      chiefs of the Douglases,&mdash;the Earl of Angus and his brother, Sir
      George&mdash;to obtain the Royal child and the great castles, and the
      <span class="pagenum">170</span><a name="link170" id="link170"></a>Crown
      of Scotland, without drawing sword. Baffled in this by the adroitness and
      patriotic courage of Cardinal Beaton, he sent his forces to rob, burn, and
      slay through all the eastern and central Marches. In February 1545,
      Hertford had finished his own work of ruin, despite which the Earl of
      Angus declared that he loved Henry VIII "best of all men." There followed
      a breach in this tender sentiment, <i>amantium irai.</i> Hertford's
      lieutenants, Evers and Laiton, with "assured Scots" of Teviotdale, wearing
      St George's cross, were harrying the Border. The Scottish Regent, the
      fickle, futile, good-humoured Earl of Arran, called for forces, but met
      little response, for, as a contemporary diarist writes, all men suspected
      the treachery of Henry's lover, and of the Douglases, "ever false, as they
      alleged." Yet Scott, in his ballad of "The Eve of St John," speaks of "the
      Douglas true and the bold Buccleugh"; the Scotts of Buccleuch, in fact,
      were ever loyal. The Laird, approached with bribes in English gold,
      rejected them in language of such pardonable profanity as frightened and
      astonished the English envoy, accustomed to buy Scottish traitors by the
      gross.
    </p>
    <p>
      So mixed were affairs that while Wharton was trying to kidnap Sir George
      Douglas for Henry, Sir George was endeavouring to betray Arran to the
      English. They worsted the pacific Regent near Melrose, burned town and
      abbey, and desecrated the ancestral graves there of the Douglases, among
      them the resting place of the Earl who fell, when "a dead man won a
      fight," at Otterburne. The English clearly did not understand that Angus
      and his brother were eager to make their peace with Henry by relieving
      their treacheries to their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruining of his ancestors' tombs aroused the personal fury of Angus,
      moreover Henry had made large gifts of Angus's lands to Evers and Laiton.
      Angus therefore gathered his forces, breathed out threats, and joined
      hands with Arran, who was also supported by a very brave man, Norman
      Leslie, <span class="pagenum">171</span><a name="link171" id="link171"></a>presently
      to be one of the assassins of Cardinal Beaton&mdash;in Henry's interest.
      Norman, however, was patriotic for the moment, and the bold Buccleuch was
      ever trusty. As Angus and Arran followed the English, Leslie and Buccleuch
      "came lightly riding in" and the Scots united on the wide airy moor of
      Ancrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English saw their approach, and saw their horses moving to the rear.
      Supposing that the Scots were in retreat, (they meant to fight on foot,
      and only sent their mounts to the rear,) the lances of Evers and Laiton
      galloped gaily in pursuit. But what they found was "the dark impenetrable
      wood" of stubborn spears. With the sun and the wind and blown smoke in
      their faces, the English cavalry charged, and were broken on the <i>schiltroms</i>
      or serried squares as they were broken at Bannockburn. Hereon the clan
      Ker, the men of Cessford and Ferniehirst, "assured Scots," tore off their
      crosses of St. George, and charged with Leslie, the Douglases, and
      Buccleuch. The English were routed, the country people rose against them;
      Evers and Laiton lost their new lands with their lives, eight hundred of
      the English were slain, and two thousand were taken alive&mdash;which is
      rather surprising. The English evacuated Jedburgh, and the Scots recovered
      Coldingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the good-natured, false, feckless Regent Arran wept over the
      dead body of Sir Ralph Evers. "God have mercy on him, for he was a fell
      cruel man, and over cruel. And welaway that ever such a slaughter and
      blood shed should be among Christian men," sobbed the Regent. His heart
      was better than his head. Even George Douglas had warned Henry VIII of
      what would result from "the extreme war that is used in killing women and
      young children." In my childhood I heard and never forgot, the country
      rhyme on an Amazon of a girl, who, to avenge her lover, took arms at
      Ancrum moor. She fell, and on her tomb, which has been many times
      restored, the following epitaph is <span class="pagenum">172</span><a

      About Ancrum the Ale, like the Jed, and, over the Border, the Eden and
      Coquet, beautifies itself by cutting a deep channel through the fine red
      sandstone of which Melrose Abbey is built. These channels are always
      beautiful, but Ale, otherwise, as we ascend its valley, is a quiet trout
      stream "that flows the green hills under." In my boyhood, long, long ago,
      Ale abounded in excellent trout, and was my favourite among all our many
      streams. It does not require the angler to wade, like Tweed and Ettrick;
      it is narrow and easily commanded. The trout were almost as guileless as
      they were beautiful and abundant; but I presume that they are now almost
      exterminated by fair and unfair methods. The Scot, when he does not use
      nets, poisons, and dynamite, is too often a fisher with the worm, and, as
      I remember him, had no idea of returning even tiny fish to the water, as
      James Thomson, author of The Seasons, himself a Border angler, advises us
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guileless, indeed, since old time has been the character of the trout of
      Ale. Sir Thomas Dick Lauder tells how in his boyhood he went once with a
      chance-met "souter" from Selkirk to the long pool in Ale above Midlem
      bridge, and how there, <span class="pagenum">173</span><a name="link173"
      id="link173"></a>by a most unsporting device, they captured the innocent
      trout almost by the sack-load. "We came," he says, "to a very long
      gravelly-bottomed pool, of an equal depth all over of from three to four
      feet. Here the souter seated himself; and, shortening both our rods, and
      fitting each of them with the three hooks tied back to back, he desired us
      to follow him, and then waded right into the middle of the pool. The whole
      water was sweltering with fine trouts, rushing in all directions from the
      alarm of our intrusion among them. But after we had stood stock still for
      a few moments, their alarm went off, and they began to settle each
      individually in his own place. 'There's a good one there,' said the
      souter, pointing to one at about three yards from him; and throwing the
      hooks over him, he jerked him up, and in less than six seconds he was safe
      in his creel. We had many a failure before we could succeed in catching
      one, whilst the souter never missed; but at length we hit upon the way;
      and so we proceeded with our guide, gently shifting our position in the
      pool as we exhausted each particular spot, until the souter's creel would
      hold no more, and ours was more than half filled with trouts, most of
      which were about three-quarters of a pound in weight; and very much
      delighted with the novelty of our sport, we made our way back to Melrose
      by the western side of the Eildon hills, and greatly astonished our
      companion with the slaughter we had made, seeing that he had been out
      angling for a couple of hours in the Tweed, without catching a single
      fin." A slaughter of the innocents, indeed! But the most inveterate
      poacher could not now, in any Border stream, hope to rival a feat so
      abominable in the eyes of present-day fishers. Nor, if he did attempt it,
      would he be likely to find trout so utterly devoid of guile as to submit
      thus quietly to be hooked out of the water one by one till the pool was
      emptied. Trout are better educated, if fewer in number, than they appear
      to have been eighty or ninety years ago. It is difficult, too, to see
      where the fun of this form of fishing comes in, after the rather <span
      class="pagenum">174</span><a name="link174" id="link174"></a>cheap
      excitement of catching the first one or two. But they did curious things
      in the name of Sport in the earlier half of last century. Many of the
      methods of catching salmon that are written of approvingly by Scrope, that
      great angler of Sir Walter's day, are now the rankest of poaching, and are
      prohibited by law.

      The mid course of Ale is through "ancient Riddel's fair domain," as Scott

      Further up, Ale rests in the dull deep loch of Alemuir, which looks as if
      it held more pike than trout. And so we follow her into the hills and the
      water-shed that, on one side, contributes feeders to the Ettrick. It is a
      lofty land of pasture and broken hills, whence you see the airy peaks of
      Skelfhill, Penchrise, the Dumon, and the ranges of "mountains" as Scott
      calls the hills through which the Border Waters run, Yarrow, Ettrick,
      Borthwick Water and Ale Water. A "water" is larger than a "burn," but
      attains not to the name of a river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule, the next tributary as we ascend Teviot, is but a "Water," a pretty
      trout stream it would be if it had fair play. The question of fishing in
      this country is knotted. Almost all the trout streams were open to
      everybody, in my boyhood, when I could fish all day in Tweed or Ale, and
      never see a rod but my own. The few anglers were sportsmen. "Duffer" as I
      was, I remember a long summer day on Tweed at Yair, when, having come too
      late for the ten o'clock "rise" of trout, I had an almost empty creel.
      Just before sunset I foregathered with old Adam Linton, his large creel
      three-quarters full of beauties. "What did you get them with?" I asked. At
      the moment he was using the tiniest midges, and the finest tackle. "Oh,
      wi' ae thing and another, according to the time o' day," he answered. I
      daresay he used the clear water worm, fished up stream; deadly sin m
      Hampshire, but not in the Forest. Since these days the world has gone wild
      on angling, the waters are crowded like the Regent's canal with rods. Now
      I am all for letting every man have his cast; but the only present hope
      for the survival of trout is in the associations of anglers who do their
      best to put down netting and dynamiting. A close time when trout are out
      of season, we owe to Sir Herbert Maxwell, opposed as he was by the Radical
      Member for the Border Burghs. I <span class="pagenum">177</span><a
      name="link177" id="link177"></a>am not sure that there is a rule against
      slaying trout under, shall we say, seven inches? However it may be, I had
      my chance and wasted it; being a duffer. Trout may become extinct like the
      Dodo; it makes no odds to me. I never cast fly in Rule, nor even examined
      "the present spiritless parish church," on the site of a Norman church of
      the early twelfth century. The few relics of carved stone fill Sir Herbert
      Maxwell's heart with bitterness against the dull destroyers. Our
      Presbyterian forefathers, as far as in them lay, destroyed every vestige
      of the noble art whereof these glens were full, when, in the twelfth
      century, the Border was part of a civilised country. For all that I know,
      they were innocent of ruin at Bedrule; the English of Henry VIII may here,
      as all through this region, have been the destroyers. They were
      Protestants of a sort. Moreover in Rule dwelt the small but fierce clan of
      Turnbull, who, between Scotts and Kers, fought both of these great clans,
      and now, as a power, "are a' wede awa'." Perhaps an enemy of theirs took
      sanctuary in the church, and they "burned the chapel for very rage," as
      the Scotts burned St. Mary of the Lowes shortly before the Reformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere about 1620, Rule Water had her minstrel, named Robin, nick-named
      "Sweet-milk," from the place of his residence. In my opinion these singers
      of the late days of James VI and I, were the survivors of the Border
      minstrels who, says Queen Mary's Bishop of Ross, Lesley, the historian,
      made their own ballads of raids and rescues, such as <i>Jock o' the Cow</i>,
      and as much as is not Scott's of <i>Kinmont Willie</i>. There was a rival
      minstrel, Willie Henderson, whom I take to have sided with the Scotts,
      while Robin was the Demodocus of the Eliotts of Stobs. The pair met,
      drank, fought, and Willie pinked "Sweet-Milk" Robin, the Eliotts' man.

    <p>
      says Sir Walter, but what was the cause of the quarrel? I have a
      hypothesis. The famous ballad of <i>Jamie Telfer</i> exists in two <span
      class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178" id="link178"></a>versions. In
      one the Scotts are covered with laurels, while Martin Eliott plays the
      part of a cur. In the other, the Eliotts gain all the glory, while Scott
      of Buccleuch acts like a mean dastard. One of these versions is the
      original, the other is a perversion. The ballad itself, which takes us all
      through the Border, from Bewcastle on the English side, to the fair
      Dodhead on Upper Ettrick, is not of the period of the incidents described.
      As far as these are historical, the date is about 1596. The author of the
      ballad does not know the facts, and makes incredible statements.
      Consequently he is late, writes years after the Union of the Crowns (1603)
      and the end of Border raids. I guess that either Will Henderson was the
      author of the ballad in favour of the Scotts, and that Robin, the minstrel
      of the Eliotts, perverted it into the Eliott version, or <i>vice versa</i>,
      Robert was the original author, Will the perverter. Here, in any case, was
      infringement of copyright and deadly insult. The poets fought. Certainly,
      Robin fell, and the Eliotts hanged Will, gave him "Jeddart justice." To

      These high powers, the Scott and Eliott clans, like the States of Europe,
      were now allies, cementing their federacy by intermarriages; and again
      were bitter foes. The strength of the chief of the Eliotts was in
      Liddesdale, of the Scotts, in Teviotdale. They were allies for young James
      V against his Keepers, the Douglases,

      1564-66, in Queen Mary's reign, when Martin Eliott, chief of his clan,
      plotted with the Armstrongs to betray her strong fortress of Hermitage to
      the English.

      In this feud the Eliotts attacked Scott of Hassendean in his tower on

      This Gilbert, at all events, married the daughter of the Flower of Yarrow,
      the wife of Auld Wat Scott of Harden, himself the neighbour and foremost
      fighting man of the laird of Branksome in Teviot, the bold Buccleuch. His
      descendant, Sir Walter, has made Auld Wat's name immortal, and, in Jamie
      Telftr, has certainly interpolated a spirited stanza.

      In the village of Denholm, on Teviot, opposite to Hassendean, was born
      John Leyden, the great friend of Scott, a poet in his way, but much more
      remarkable as a man of amazing energy of character, an Orientalist, and a
      collector of ballads. But few now know what

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His memory is twined with that of Sir Walter, and he is one of <span
      class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a>the most
      living figures in Lockhart's Life of Scott. Leyden had the poetic quality,
      not judiciously cultivated, of the old Border minstrels, while the energy
      which the clans expended in war was given by him to omnivorous studies.

    <p>
      Below Denholm, but on the other side of the river, nearly opposite the
      junction of Rule Water with Teviot, is Minto, in the fourteenth century a
      property owned by one of that unruly clan, the Turnbulls. Later, it passed
      to the family of Stewart, and finally, somewhere about the beginning of
      the eighteenth century, it was bought by Sir Gilbert Elliot, ancestor of
      the Minto branch of that family. The present house dates only from 1814,
      but it has a curious legend attached to it, which is mentioned in Sir
      Walter Scott's diary, under date 23rd December, 1825. He says: "It is very
      odd that the common people about Minto and the neighbourhood will not
      believe at this hour that the first Earl is dead." [He died in June,
      1814.] "They think he had done something in India which he could not
      answer for&mdash;that the house was rebuilt on a scale unusually large to
      give him a suite of secret apartments, and that he often walks about the
      woods and crags of Minto at night, with a white nightcap and long white
      beard. The circumstances of his having died on the road down to Scotland
      is the sole foundation of this absurd legend, which shows how willing the
      public are to gull themselves when they can find no one else to take the
      trouble. I have seen people who could read, write, and cipher, shrug their
      shoulders and look mysterious when this subject was mentioned. One very
      absurd addition was made on occasion of a great ball at Minto House, which
      it was said was given to draw all people away from the grounds, that the
      concealed Earl might have leisure for his exercise."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the east of Minto House are Minto Crags, towering precipitous to a
      height of over seven hundred feet. On the summit is the ruin called
      Fatlips Castle, which is said to have been the stronghold of the
      fourteenth-century owner of Minto, <span class="pagenum">181</span><a
      name="link181" id="link181"></a>Turnbull of Barnhill, a notorious Border
      freebooter. A small grassy platform, or level space, a little below the
      ruin, is called Barnhill's Bed, "Where Barnhill hew'd his bed of flint,"&mdash;a
      convenient spot, no doubt, in old days on which to station a sentry or
      look-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto was apparently in his own way
      something of a poet, but the ever tolerant Sir Walter Scott, to whom he
      used to read his compositions, confesses that the verses were "but
      middling," Sir Gilbert had, however, a better title, at least to
      collateral fame; he was the brother of the Jean Elliot who wrote that
      undying lament, the "Flowers of the Forest."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious to note that in 1374 the church of Minto belonged to the
      diocese of Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at Minto, if credence in the reality of Fairies no longer lingers
      amongst the people,&mdash;one of the writers of this volume records, some
      chapters back, that he found traces of the belief not very many years ago
      still surviving at Flodden Edge,&mdash;at least but a very few generations
      have passed since it died. Throughout Teviotdale, perhaps to a greater
      extent than in any other part of the Border, tales still are told which
      show how strong was once this belief in the existence of the Little Folk,
      and many of the customs that, we are told, were followed by country
      dwellers in order to propitiate the Good People, or to thwart their
      malevolence, are very quaint, Should it chance, for instance, that at the
      time a child was born the blue bonnet usually worn by the husband was not
      kept continually lying on the mother's bed, then there would be the most
      imminent danger of that child being carried off by the Fairies, and a
      changeling being left in its place. Many a fine child has been lost
      through neglect of this simple precaution. Generally, if the abduction
      took place before the child had been christened, a pig or a hedgehog, or
      some such animal, was substituted for the infant; but if the Fairies did
      not succeed in their design till after the child's baptism, then they left
      another bairn in its <span class="pagenum">182</span><a name="link182"
      id="link182"></a>place, usually a peevish, ill-thriven, wizen-faced little
      imp. A tale is told of a woman who lived at Minto Cragfoot, and whose
      child, in consequence of some trifling lark of precaution in the matter of
      the blue bonnet, was carried off, and in the end was rescued only by the
      superior knowledge and power of a Presbyterian minister. Whilst she
      herself was engaged one day in gathering sticks for her fire, the woman
      had laid her child beside a bush on the hill side. She neither heard nor
      saw anything unusual, but on going to pick up her child at the close of
      her task, instead of her bonny, smiling little son she found only a thin,
      wasted, weird little creature, which "yammered" and wept continually.
      Recourse was had to the Reverend Mr. Borland, (first Presbyterian minister
      of Bedrule after the Reformation,) and that gentleman at once
      unhesitatingly pronounced that this was no mere human child. The mother
      must go to the cliffs, said Mr. Borland, and there gather a quantity of
      the flowers of the fox glove, (locally called "witches thimbles,") and
      bring them to him. These Mr. Borland boiled, poured some of the extract
      into the bairn's mouth, scattered the boiled flowers all over its body,
      then put it in its cradle wrapped in a blanket, and left it all night
      alone in the barn. Mr. Borland took the key of the door away with him, and
      gave instructions that under no circumstances was anybody to enter the
      barn until he returned next day. The anxious mother watched all night by
      the door, but heard no sound; never once did the child wail. And next
      morning when Mr. Borland arrived he was able to hand to the mother her own
      child, fat and smiling as when carried off by the fairies. It was a heroic
      remedy, but probably the sick child did not swallow much of that decoction
      of <i>digitalis</i>. In any case, they did not have coroners' inquests in
      those days, and had the worst come to the worst, the uncomplaining fairies
      would have borne the blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was up Teviot, in the days when witches flourished, that a poor woman
      lived, whose end was rather more merciless than <span class="pagenum">183</span><a
      name="link183" id="link183"></a>that inflicted on most of her kind. A
      man's horse had died suddenly,&mdash;elf-struck, or overlooked by a witch,
      of course. To break whatever spell the witch or elf might have cast over
      other animals the owner of the dead horse cut out and burnt its heart.
      Whilst the fire was at its fiercest and the heart sizzling in the glow,
      there rushed up a large black greyhound, flecked all over with foam and
      evidently in the last stage of fatigue, which tried persistently to snatch
      the heart from the fire. One of the spectators, suspecting evil, seized a
      stick and struck the animal a heavy blow over the back, whereupon, with a
      fearful yell, it fled, and disappeared. Almost at that instant, a villager
      ran up, saying that his wife had suddenly been taken violently ill; and
      when those who had been engaged in burning the heart went in to the man's
      cottage, they found his wife, a dark-haired, black-eyed woman, lying,
      gasping and breathless, with her back, to their thinking, broken. She,
      poor woman, was probably suffering from a sudden and particularly acute
      attack of lumbago. But to those wise men another inference was only too
      obvious. She was, of course, a witch, and it was <i>she</i> who, in the
      guise of a greyhound, had tried to snatch the horse's heart from the fire,
      and who had then got a stroke across her back that broke it. They insisted
      that she should repeat the Lord's prayer,&mdash;an infallible test, for if
      she were a witch she would be sure to say: "lead us into temptation, and
      deliver us not from evil." And so, when the poor woman, her pain failed to
      get through the prayer to their satisfaction, they bound her, carried her
      away, and burnt her alive in the fire where the horse's heart had been
      roasted.

      Two or three miles across the river from Minto is Ruberslaw, a rugged
      hill, towering dark and solitary, a land-mark for half the Border. More
      than any of its distant neighbours in the Cheviot range, it seems to draw
      to itself the hurrying rain clouds, more than any other it seems to
      nurture storms. About its grim head all Teviotdale <span class="pagenum">184</span><a

      Like many another wild Border hill, Ruberslaw was a favourite lurking
      place for the persecuted Covenanters, and near its top is a craggy chasm
      from which, it is said, Wodrow's "savoury Mr. Peden" used to preach to his
      scattered congregation. It was on this hill that the pursuing dragoons all
      but caught the preacher and his flock one day; they were caught, indeed,
      like rats in a trap, had it not been for Ruberslaw's well known character
      for breeding bad weather. The soldiers were advancing in full view of the
      conventicle. Way of escape there was none, nor time to disperse; mounted
      men from every quarter were scrambling up the steep face of the hill, and
      in that clear light what chance was left now to hide among the rocks and
      boulders!" "O Lord," prayed Peden with extreme fervour, "lap the skirts of
      thy cloak ower puir auld Sandy." And as if in answer to his petition,
      there came over the entire hill a thick "Liddesdale drow," so dense that a
      man might not see two feet around him. When the mist cleared again, there
      was no one left for the dragoons to take.

      Above Hassendean, but on the other side of Teviot, is one of the few
      remaining possessions in this country, namely Cavers, of the great and
      ancient House of the Black Douglases. The relics are a very old flag; its
      date and history are variously explained by family legend and by
      antiquaries. It is not a pennon, therefore not Hotspur's pennon taken by
      the Earl of Douglas before the battle of Otterburne. It is nothing of the
      Percys', for it bears the Douglas Heart and a Douglas motto. On the whole
      it seems to have belonged not to the Black, but to their rivals and
      successors, the Red Douglases, who were as unruly, and "ill to lippen to"
      by Scottish kings, as the elder branch. <span class="pagenum">185</span><a

      As we ascend, the water of Teviot becomes more and more foul; varying,
      when last I shuddered at it, from black to a most unwholesome light blue.
      It is distressing to see such a fluid flowing through beautiful scenes;
      and possibly since I mingled my tears with the polluted stream, the
      manufacturers of Hawick have taken some order in the way of more or less
      filtering their refuse and their dyes.

      Hawick, to the best of my knowledge, contains no objects of interest to
      the tourist who "picturesques it everywhere." A <span class="pagenum">186</span><a

      contains part of an ancient keep of the Douglases&mdash;"Doulanwrack's

      The people of Hawick have retained many of the characteristics of the old
      Borderers; they are redoubted foes at football; and are said to be not
      very scrupulous raiders&mdash;of mushrooms. Their local patriotism is
      fervid, and they sing with passion their song of "Teribus and Teriodden,"
      which refers to "Sons of heroes slain at Flodden,"&mdash;among other
      Flowers of the Forest. And, like their neighbours at Selkirk, they cherish
      a banner, said to have been captured from the English. The Hawick <span

      It would be a gratifying thing to prove that the memory of ancient
      Scandinavian deities has survived the sway of the mediaeval Church and the
      Kirk of John Knox. But I have not heard that the words occur in documents
      before the eighteenth century. The town has a site naturally beautiful, as
      Slitrig, a very rapid stream, here joins Teviot, which, above the mills of
      Hawick is <i>electro clarior</i>; not of a pure crystal translucency, but

      The rivulet is said to well out from a small, black, fathomless little
      loch high up on the hill. Here, as all knew, dwelt the Keipic, or other
      irritable spirit prone to resent human intrusion, and if a stone should
      chance to be thrown into the depths of the lakelet, <span class="pagenum">190</span><a
      name="link190" id="link190"></a>resentment was pretty sure to be expressed
      by a sudden dangerous overflow of water into the burn, whereby destruction
      would be carried down the valley. That, tradition tells, is how Hawick
      came to be devastated, and all but swept away, early in the eighteenth
      century. A shepherd, it was said, had quite accidentally rolled a large
      stone into the lake, and had thus roused the Spirit of the mountain to
      ungovernable fury. Leyden thus writes of the tradition:

      Borthwick Water, too, as well as Slitrig, was famed for its fairies&mdash;and
      for worse than fairies, if one may judge by the name given to a deep pool;
      the Deil's Pool, it is called, a place to be shunned by youthful fishers.
      But probably the youthful fisher of the twentieth century cares neither
      for deil nor for fairy. Higher up the stream than this pool is the Fairy
      Knowe, where a shepherd was once flung into the flooded <span

      flung him in.

      One very odd relic hard by Hawick is a mote, or huge tumulus, of the kind
      so common in Galloway. Probably above it was erected a palisaded wooden
      fortress, perhaps of the twelfth century. The area, as far as an amateur
      measurement can determine, is not less than that of the tower of
      Goldielands, an old keep of the Scotts, some two miles further up the
      water, almost opposite to the point where Borthwick Water flows <span

      If we cross the bridge here and follow the pretty wandering water through
      a level haugh, and then turn off to the right, we arrive at a deep thickly
      wooded dene, and from the crest above this excellent hiding place of
      raided cattle looks down the old low house of Harden, (the Stammschloss of
      Sir Walter Scott,) now the property of Lord Polwarth, the head of this
      branch of the Scotts of Buccleuch. The house is more modern than the many
      square keeps erected in the old days of English invasions and family
      feuds. The Borthwick Water turns to the left, and descends from the
      heights of Howpasley, whence the English raiders rode down, "laigh down in
      Borthwick Water," in the ballad of <i>Jamie Telfer</i>. A mile or a little
      more above Goldielands Tower, on the left side of Teviot is Branksome
      Tower, the residence of the Lady of Branksome in <i>The Lay of the Last

      Yet, looking at Mr. Thompson's excellent sketch, you would scarce guess
      it. The house stands very near the Teviot, but still nearer the public

      The Lady of Branksome who finished the actual house after the old
      stronghold had been burned, appears to have thought that square keeps and
      barmkyns were obsolete in war, owing to the increasing merits of
      artillery; and she did not build a house of defence. Manifestly "nine and
      twenty Knights of fame" never "hung their shields in" <i>this</i>
      "Branksome Hall," and never were here attended by "nine and twenty Squires
      of name," and "nine and twenty yeomen tall." <span class="pagenum">195</span><a
      name="link195" id="link195"></a>There is no room for them, and at
      Branlcsome, probably, there never was. It is not to be credited that, at
      any period, ten of the knights went to bed "sheathed in steel," to be
      ready for the English, or

      The minstrel gave free play to his fancy. The Laird of Branksome, though
      Warden of the Marches, never had, never needed, so vast a retinue, and was
      so far from "Warkworth or Naworth, or merry Carlisle" that no Scrope, or
      Howard, or Percy, could fall on him at unawares.

      The Scotts, in the reign of James I, already owned the wild upland
      pastoral region of Buccleuch between Teviot and Ettrick, and Eckford in
      Teviotdale; also Murdiestone on the lower Clyde, a place now too near the
      hideous industrial towns and villages near Glasgow. Meanwhile a pacific
      gentleman named Inglis was laird of Branksome. He grumbled, it is said, to
      Sir Walter Scott of Murdiestone about the inconveniences caused by English
      raiders; though, as they had a long way to ride, Inglis probably suffered
      more at Branksome from the Kers, Douglases, and ferocious Turnbulls. Scott
      was not a nervous man, and he offered to barter Murdiestone for half of
      Branksome, which came into his pastoral holdings at Buccleuch. Inglis
      gladly made the exchange, and Scott's son obtained the remaining half of
      the barony of Branksome, in reward of his loyalty to James II, during his
      struggle with the Black Douglases, (during which he dirked his guest, the
      Earl, at the hospitable table.) The Scott lands, carved out of those of
      the fallen Douglases, extended from Lanarkshire to Langholm; and as they
      were loyal to their country, (at least till the reign of Charles I,) and
      withal were fighting men of the best, they throve to Earl's estate, the
      dukedom coming in with the ill <span class="pagenum">196</span><a
      name="link196" id="link196"></a>fated marriage of the heiress to James,
      son of Charles II, Duke of Monmouth. Of course if Charles II really
      married Lucy Walters, (as Monmouth's pious Whiggish adherents asserted,)
      the Duke of Buccleuch would be our rightful king.

    <p>
      But the good king, Charles II, firmly denied the marriage, fond as he was
      of his handsome son by Lucy Walters; and the good House of Buccleuch has
      never believed in the Whig fable of the black box which contained the
      marriage lines of Lucy Walters and Charles II. The marriage of Monmouth
      with the heiress of Buccleuch was made in their extreme youth and was
      unhappy. Monmouth was in love, like Lord Ailesbury, with Lady Henrietta
      Wentworth, whom he (according to Ailesbury,) spoke of as "his wife in the
      sight of God," which means that she was not his wife at all.

      The house of Branksome makes a picturesque object in the middle distance
      of the landscape; but is not otherwise <span class="pagenum">197</span><a
      name="link197" id="link197"></a>interesting. In front of the door lies, or
      used to lie, a rusty iron breach-loading culverin of the fourteenth
      century; of old, no doubt, part of the artillery of the castle, when it
      was a castle.

      Returning from Branksome Tower to the right bank of Teviot, now a clear
      and musical stream, we cross one of the many Allan Waters so common in
      Scotland, and arrive at Caerlanrig, where there is a tablet with an
      inscription bitterly blaming James V, for his treachery to Johnny
      Armstrong of Gilnockie in Eskdale, hanged in 1530. The Armstrongs, being
      next neighbours of England on the Border, were a clan of doubtful
      allegiance, given to intermarrying with the English, and sometimes wearing
      the cross of St. George as "assured Scots." They were the greatest of
      reivers on both sides of the Border. In 1530, James V, who had escaped
      from the Douglases, and driven Angus, their chief, into the service of
      Henry VIII, tried to bring the country into order. He first arrested the
      chief men&mdash;Bothwell (Hepburn), Ferniehirst (Ker), Max<span
      class="pagenum">198</span><a name="link198" id="link198"></a>well, Home,
      Buccleuch (his old ally), Polwarth, and Johnston; and, having kept them
      out of mischief, led a large force into their region. He caught Scott of
      Tushielaw in Ettrick, and Cockburn of Henderland on Meggat Water. Cockburn
      was tried in Edinburgh for theft and treason, and beheaded; not hanged at
      his own door as legend fables. He was in the conspiracy of Henry VIII and
      Angus, and had sided with invaders. Tushielaw suffered for oppression of
      his tenants. Numbers of lairds, Kers, Douglases, Rutherfurds, Turnbulls,
      Swintons, Veitches, put themselves on the King's mercy and gave sureties
      for quiet behaviour. Gilnockie, according to the ballad, came to the King
      at Caerlanrig in royal array, with forty retainers. I find no contemporary
      account of the circumstances, for Lindsay of Pitscottie gives but late
      gossip, as he always does. Calderwood, still later, says that Johnie "was
      enticed by some courtiers." Calderwood adds that one of the sufferers with
      Johnie had burned a woman and her children in her house. The evidence for
      Royal treachery is that of the ballad of Johnie Armstrong, which may have
      been the source and authority of ritscottie. We may quote it. It was a
      favourite of Sir Walter Scott.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII TWEED, ST. BOSWELLS, DRYBURGH, NEWSTEAD, AND THE LEADER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e now return from
      Teviotdale to Tweed, which we left at Kelso. The river passes through one
      of its rock-fenced and narrow defiles at the Trows of Makerstoun, (accent
      the penultimate,) itself the home from ancient days of a branch of the
      once great Argyll clan&mdash;and generally western clan&mdash;of
      Mac-dougal. How they came so far from their Celtic kindred, potent in
      Dalriadic Scotland before the Campbells came to the front as allies of
      Robert Bruce, is not known to me. As foes of Bruce, the Macdougals of Lome
      suffered much loss of lands after the king's triumph. At the Trows the
      river splits into very deep and narrow channels, and to shoot one of them
      in a canoe needs a daring and a fortunate paddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      In former years there were four of these channels, two of very great depth&mdash;thirty
      feet and more, it is said&mdash;but so narrow that, with the river at
      summer level, it was possible for an active man to jump from stone rib to
      stone rib, across the swift rushing stream. The feat was attempted once
      too often, however, with fatal result, and since then the middle rib has
      been blasted out, so that it is no longer possible for any one to tempt
      fate in this manner. Even an expert and powerful swimmer, filling in
      there, would have but a slender chance of coming out alive, for if he were
      not sucked under by the eddies of that boiling current and jammed beneath
      some sunken ledge, <span class="pagenum">205</span><a name="link205"
      id="link205"></a>the odds would be very great on his brains being knocked
      out amongst the rocks that thrust their ugly fangs here and there above
      the surface of the stream. Both below and above the Trows, the trout
      fishing&mdash;for those who may fish&mdash;is extremely good, but the
      wading is licklish; pot-holes, ledges, and large boulders are apt to trap
      the unwary to their undoing. There are, too, some excellent salmon casts
      in the Makerstoun Water, and it was in one of them that the famous Rob o'
      the Trows&mdash;Rob Kerss, a great character in Sir Walter's day,&mdash;nigh
      on a hundred years ago landed a fish so huge, that even a master of the
      art so skilled as Rob,&mdash;Stoddart says he had few equals as a fisher&mdash;was
      utterly spent when at length his silvery prize lay gasping on the bank.
      Before taking the fly from its mouth, Rob turned half aside to pick up a
      stone which might conveniently be used as a "priest"; but even as he
      turned, out of the tail of his eye he saw the monster give a wallop. Rob
      leapt for the fish. Alas! as he jumped, his foot caught the line and
      snapped it, and walloping fish and struggling man plunged together off a
      shelf into the icy water,&mdash;from which Rob emerged alone. The rod with
      which Kerss killed so many hundreds of fish is still in the possession of
      one of his descendants, near Beattock. Compared with present-day
      masterpieces of greenheart or split cane, it is a quaint and clumsy
      weapon, of extraordinary thickness in the butt, and of crushing weight.
      The writer has handled it, and he is convinced that one hour's use could
      not fail to choke off for the rest of the day even the most enthusiastic
      of modern salmon fishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not often that ancient weapons are found in Tweed, but some years
      ago, when the river was unusually low, a moss-trooper's spear was
      recovered at a spot a little above Makerstoun. It was lying at the bottom,
      below what used to be a ford of sorts across the river. Curiously enough,
      shaft and head were both intact, and in fair preservation after their long
      immersion. If the spear was not used by some trooper in days when fighting
      was the Borderer's chief <span class="pagenum">206</span><a name="link206"
      id="link206"></a>delight and occupation, it is difficult to imagine to
      what use it could have been put. Salmon cannot be successfully speared
      with a single-pointed unbarbed weapon; so that it is certain this was no
      poacher's implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above Makerstoun is Rutherford, once the home of the Rutherfurds of that
      Ilk, but now it knows them no more. A like doom, as I write, hangs over
      Mertoun, long the beautiful home of the Scotts of Harden, Lord Polwarth's
      family.

    <p>
      Mertoun is a modern house; hard by it, across the river, the strong ruins
      of Littledean tower (once the Kers') speak of old Border wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the curves of Tweed we reach St. Boswells, named after an
      Anglo-Saxon saint to whom St. Cuthbert came, laying down his spear, and
      entering religion. At St. Boswells are sheep fairs; Hogg preferred to
      attend one of these festivals rather than go to London and see the
      Coronation of George IV. My sympathies are with the shepherd! The paths
      near Lessudden, hard by, are haunted by a quiet phantasm in costume a
      minister of the Kirk of the eighteenth century. I know some of the
      percipients who have seen him individually and collectively. There is no
      tradition about the origin of this harmless appearance, a vision of a
      dream of the dead; walking "in that sleep of death."
    </p>
    <p>
      Above Lessudden the Tweed winds round and at the foot of the beautiful
      ruins of Dryburgh Abbey, softly mourning for him who lies within that
      sound "the dearest of all to his ear," Sir Walter Scott. The great
      Magician lies, with Lockhart at <span class="pagenum">207</span><a
      name="link207" id="link207"></a>his feet, within the ruined walls, in the
      place which, as he wrote to his bride that was to be, he had already
      chosen for his rest. The lady replied with spirit that she would not
      endure any such sepulchral reflections.

    <p>
      This is one of the most sacred places, and most beautiful places in broad
      Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching Dryburgh, not from the riverside but from the road, we come by
      such a path through a beautiful wood as <span class="pagenum">208</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a>that in which proud Maisie was "walking so
      early," when "bold Robin on the bush singing so rarely," spaed her
      fortune. The path leads to a place of such unexpected beauty as the
      ruinous palace where the Sleeping Beauty slumbered through the ages. The
      beauty is that of Dryburgh itself, delicately fair in her secular decay;
      fallen from glory, indeed, but still the last home of that peace which
      dwelt in this much harried Borderland in the days of the first White
      Friars, and of good St. David the king. They were Englishmen out of
      Northumberland, teachers of good farming and of other good works. What
      remains of their dwellings is of the age when the round Norman arch
      blended with the pointed Gothic, as in the eastern end of the Cathedral of
      St. Andrews. Thrice the English harmed it, in the days of Bruce (1322)
      during a malicious and futile attack by Edward II; again, under Robert II,
      when Richard II played the Vandal; and, lastly, during the wasting of the
      Border in 1544, which was the eighth Henry's rough wooing for his son, of
      the babe Mary Stuart. The grounds, the property of a member of the House
      of Scott's eccentric Earl of Buchan, are kept in charming order. The Earl
      was the only begetter of a huge statue of Sir William Wallace, who used
      Ettrick Forest now and again in his guerilla warfare, and from the Forest
      drew his archers, tall men whom n death the English of Edward I admired on
      the lost field of Falkirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The said Earl of Buchan rather amused than consoled Scott, during a severe
      illness, by promising to attend to his burial in the place so dear to him,
      which, till the ruin of his paternal grandmother, had belonged to the
      Haliburtons, also n old days the lords of Dirleton castle. Readers of
      Lockhart remember the great Border gathering at the funeral of the latest
      minstrel, and how his horses, which drew the hearse, paused where they had
      been wont to rest, at a spot where it had been Sir Walter's habit to stop
      to admire the landscape. His chief, the young Duke of Buccleuch, was
      prevented by important <span class="pagenum">209</span><a name="link209"
      id="link209"></a>business from being an attendant. You would never guess
      what the business was! No man knows but I only; and if Scott could have
      known, I doubt whether he would have drawn his shaggy brows into a frown,
      or laughed; for the business was&mdash;&mdash;but I must not reveal so
      ancient a secret!
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving up the river on the left bank, we reach that ancient House
      concerning which Thomas of Ercildoune's prophecy is still unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Betide, Betide, whate'er betide,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There shall aye be a Haig in Bemersyde."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were at home in Bemersyde in the days of Malcolm the Maiden.
      One of them was condemned to pay a dozen salmon yearly to the monastery of
      Melrose, for some scathe done to the brethren. It must have been an ill
      year for the angler when Haig expressed a desire to commute the charge for
      an equivalent in money as he could not get the fish. There was scarce a
      Border battle in which the Haigs did not leave a representative on the
      field of honour. Here, too, befell "the Affliction of Bemersyde," when the
      laird, after a long fight with a monstrous salmon, lost him in the moment
      of victory. The head of the fish would not go into the landing net, his
      last wallop freed him; he was picked up dead, by prowlers,&mdash;and he
      weighed seventy pounds. Probably no salmon so great was ever landed by the
      rod from Tweed. Only the Keep of the mansion is of great antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be worth while to leave the river and climb to Smail-holme 'I'cwer,
      where Scott's infancy was passed. The tower, standing tall and gaunt above
      a tarn, is well known from Turner's drawing, and is the scene of Scott's
      early ballad, <i>The Eve of St. John</i>. Perhaps the verses which have
      lingered longest in my memory are those which tell how

      avatar in the eighteenth century&mdash;and later. Do ghosts repeat
      themselves? It looks like it, for the Irish tale is very well
      authenticated.

      It was not actually in the tower, but in the adjacent farmhouse of
      Sandyknowe, his grandfather's, that Scott, at first a puny child, passed
      his earliest years, absorbing every ballad and legend that the country
      people knew, and the story of <span class="pagenum">212</span><a

      from Turn Again to Ancrum Moor.

      We have reached the most beautiful part ol Tweed, dominated by the triple
      crest of the pyramidal Eildons, where the river lovingly embraces the
      woods of Gladswood and Ravens-wood, and the site of Old Melrose, a Celtic
      foundation of Aidan, while as yet the faith was preached by the Irish
      mission aries of St. Columba. This is the very garden of Tweed, a vast
      champaign, from which rise the Eildons, and far away above Rule Water "the
      stormy skirts of Ruberslaw," with the Lammermuir and Cheviot hills blue
      and faint on the northern and southern horizons.

      On the ground of Drygrange, above Bemersyde, but on the right bank of
      Tweed at Newstead, the greatest stationary camp in Scotland of Agricola's
      time has been excavated by Mr. Curie, who also describes it in a
      magnificent and learned volume. Here were found beautiful tilting helmets,
      in the shape of heads of pretty Greek girls, and here were the enamelled
      brooches of the native women who dwelt with Roman lovers. But these must
      be sought, with coins, gems, pottery, weapons and implements of that
      forgotten day, in the National Museum in Edinburgh.

      It is scarcely possible to conceive a scene more beautiful than that where
      Leader winds her cheery way through the woods of Drygrange. When the
      Borderland is starred thick <span class="pagenum">213</span><a
      name="link213" id="link213"></a>with primroses, and the grassy banks of
      Leader are carpeted with the blue of speedwell and the red of campion;
      when a soft air and warm sun hatch out a multitude of flies at which the
      trout rise greedily, then is the time to see that deep, leafy glen at the
      bottom of which sparkles the amber-clear water over its gravelly bed. In
      cliff or steep bank the sides tower up perhaps to the height of a couple
      of hundred feet, thick clad with rhododendrons and spreading undergrowth,
      and with mighty larch, beech, elm, or ash, and everywhere the music of
      Heaven's feathered orchestra smites sweetly on the ear. It is, I think, to
      this Paradise that good birds go when they die, where the ruthless small
      boy's raiding hand is kept in check, and every bird may find ideal nesting
      place.

      The district is most famous in ballad, song and story, Leaderdale, being
      apparently equivalent to Lauderdale, giving a title to the Earl of
      Lauderdale, the chief of the Maitlands. "They call it Leader town," says
      the enigmatic ballad of <i>Auld Maitland</i>, speaking of the stronghold
      of a Maitland of the days of Wallace, a shadowy figure still well
      remembered in the folk lore of the reign of Mary Stuart. The ballad has
      some good and many indifferent verses. It was known to the mother and
      uncle of James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd. He copied it out for Will
      Laidlaw, Scott's friend and amanuensis, and this began the long and
      valuable association of Hogg with the Sheriff. The authenticity of the
      ballad has been impugned, Hogg and Scott, it has been asserted, composed
      it and Scott gave it to the world as genuine. This is demonstrably an
      erroneous conjecture, (as I have shown in <i>Sir Walter Scott and the
      Border Minstrelsy</i>). Letters which had not been published refute all
      suspicions of forgery by Hogg or Scott or both. But the ballad had,
      apparently, been touched up, perhaps in the seventeenth or eighteenth
      century, probably by one of the witty and literary family of Maitland. It
      came to Hogg's mother from "auld Babby Metlan," (Maitland,) housekeeper to
      the last of the Scotts of Tushielaw; herself perhaps a reduced <span
      class="pagenum">214</span><a name="link214" id="link214"></a>member of the
      impoverished family of "the flower of the wits of Scotland," Queen Mary's
      Secretary of State, Maitland of Lethington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the legendary "Maitland or auld beard grey" may have stoutly held
      his house of Thirlestane against Edward I, (as he does in the ballad of <i>Auld
      Maitland</i>), I have found no record of the affair in the State Papers of
      the period. Thereafter the Maitlands of Lethington, though a family of
      ancient origin, play no conspicuous part in Scottish history, till we
      reach old Sir Richard, who died at the age of ninety in 1586. He was not
      openly recalcitrant against, but was no enthusiast for, the new doctrines
      of Knox and his company. A learned, humorous, peaceful man, he wrote
      Scottish verses and collected and preserved earlier poetry in manuscripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his sons the eldest, William, was&mdash;setting Knox aside&mdash;the
      most extraordinary Scott of his time. Knox was essentially Scottish in the
      good and not so good of his character, and was essentially an extreme
      Calvinist of his period; "judged too extreme," he says, by his associates.
      Young Maitland of Lethington, on the other hand, might have been French or
      Italian, hardly English. He was an absolutely modern man. In religion,
      even before the revolution of 1559, he was in favour of the new ideas, but
      also in favour of compromise and, if possible, of peace. We first meet him
      i i private discussion with Knox,&mdash;pleading for compromise, but
      yielding, with a smile, or a sigh, to the amazingly confident fallacies of
      the Reformer. He serves the Queen Mother, Mary of Guise, a brave unhappy
      lady, as Secretary of State, till he sees that her cause is every way
      impossible, and goes over to the Reformers, and wins for them the alliance
      of England, and victory. He had a great ideal, and a lofty motive, a
      patriotic desire for honourable peace and alliance with England. On all
      occasions when he encountered Knox, he met him with the "educated
      insolence" of his wit, with the blandest <i>persiflage</i>; Knox writhed
      and reports his ironies, and&mdash;Knox, in the long run, <span
      class="pagenum">215</span><a name="link215" id="link215"></a>had the
      better of this smiling modern man, no fanatic, no believer in any
      preacher's infallibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitland served Queen Mary loyally, while he might; when things went
      otherwise than he wished, was behind the scenes of the murder of Riccio;
      but was frankly forgiven as the husband of the dearest of the Four Maries,
      Mary Fleming, and as Indispensable. He and his brother John, later the
      able minister of James VI, were in the conspiracy to murder Darnley; that
      is the central mystery in his career, his part In that brutal, blundering
      needless crime. He was partner with the violent Bothwell, a brute of
      culture, who hated, captured, bullied, and threatened him; for Maitland
      discountenanced, with remarkable and solitary courage, Bothwell's
      marriage. Escaping from Bothwell's grip, he fled to the nobles who had
      risen against Bothwell; he corrupted Mary's commander in Edinburgh Castle;
      when she was a captive, he is said, by the English agent, Randolph, to
      have urged that she should be slain,&mdash;for, as she said, "she had that
      in black and white which would hang Lethington." She escaped, and his
      policy was, in his own interests, to appear to prosecute her, and secretly
      to advise and aid her; to win, if not her forgiveness, an amnesty, if she
      returned to power, which he believed to be inevitable. She hated no man
      more bitterly, but she needed no man so much. As he had lost for her
      Edinburgh Castle, he gained it for her once more by winning to her cause
      the gallant Kirkcaldy of Grange, commanding therein for her enemies. He
      lived, a disease-stricken man. through the siege of the castle, meeting
      Knox once or twice with the old insolent smooth-spoken disdain of the
      prophet. He escaped the gibbet by a natural death, when the castle
      surrendered and Kirkcaldy was hanged. This "Michael Wiley," (Scots for
      Macchiavelli,) had trusted too absolutely to his own wit, his own command
      over violent men.&mdash;trusted too much to sheer intellect; been too
      contemptuous of honour There is no one who at all resembles him in the
      history of Scotland; he <span class="pagenum">216</span><a name="link216"
      id="link216"></a>fascinates and repels us; one likes so much in him, and
      detests so much.

      From a brother's descendants came the notorious Lauderdale of the Covenant
      and the Great Rebellion; a scholar; at one time professedly godly; the
      natural and deadly opposite of the great Montrose, the coarse voluptuary
      and greedy governor of Scotland, and the servile buffoon of Charles II
      during the Restoration. He paid a trifling pension to the descendants of
      Lethington, who are so impoverished that I guess at one of them in "auld
      Babby Metlan," "other than a gude ane," who handed on the ballad of <i>Auld
      Maitland</i> and was housekeeper to the last Scott of Tushielaw on upper
      Ettrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two are the great men of Leader Water (an ideal trout stream if not
      poached out), Lethington and&mdash;St. Cuthbert! It was while he watched
      his flocks by night on the braes of Leader that Cuthbert saw, either some
      meteoric phenomenon which he misconstrued, or the soul of Bishop Aidan
      passing heavenward in glory. Next day he walked or rode to Old Melrose,
      leaned his spear on the wall at the portal, and confided to Boisil (St.
      Boswells) his desire to enter into religion. From his noble biography by
      the Venerable Bede (he has "got his step" now, I think, and is Blessed
      Bede, <i>beatus</i>), we know this great and good man, Cuthbert, chief
      missionary on the violent Border, who sleeps in Durham Cathedral. The
      English have captured him, the great glory of Leader Water, but m his
      region, in his day, the people were already English by blood to a great
      degree, and in language. Cuthbert, despite the Reformation, continued to
      be a favourite Christian name north of Tweed, witness Cuddie Headrig,
      whose mother, Mause, had nothing papistical in her convictions!
    </p>
    <p>
      By a burn that takes its rise far up Leader near a summit of the
      Lammermuirs called Nine Cairn Edge, is the Well of the Holy Water Cleuch.
      It was here that St. Cuthbert spent his shepherd boyhood; here that he saw
      the vision which sent <span class="pagenum">217</span><a name="link217"
      id="link217"></a>him to Mailros. And here, after Cuthhert's death, they
      built in his honour, beside the Holy Well, the Childeschirche, the name of
      which survives to us now as Channelkirk.

      Were one of Border birth to quit "sweet Leader Haughs," leaving unnoticed
      "True Thomas," Thomas of Ercildoune, I do not know how he might again face
      his fellow Borderers. For, though Thomas may not have been a great man, in
      the same sense that St. Cuthbert and Lethington were great, yet to most of
      his countrymen he is better known than either. For one at the present day
      to whom the name of Cuthbert is familiar, or one to whom "Lethington"
      conveys any very definite idea, you will find a hundred who take an
      intelligent interest in Thomas the Rhymer, and who believe with
      Spottis-woode, who wrote of him early in the seventeenth century: "Sure it
      is that he did divine and answer true of many things to come." Fact
      regarding the Rhymer is so vague, and so beautifully blended with fiction,
      that I doubt if most Borderers do not more than half persuade themselves
      still to accept as fact much of the fiction that they learned of him in
      childhood. To Border children, not so very long ago, nothing was more real
      than the existence of a tree, still alive and growing somewhere about the
      enchanted land of Eildon, which must necessarily be <i>the</i> Eildon
      Tree:
    </p>
    <p>

    <p class="indent15">
      "Syne he has kissed her rosy lips

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      nothing was more certain than that True Thomas, at the call of the Queen
      of Faëry, rose and obediently followed the hart and the hind into the
      forest, and returned no more.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p class="indent15">

      No spot was looked on, in early youth, with more awe than that Bogle Burn
      whose stony bed crossed over the St. Boswells and Melrose road in the
      cheerless hollow beside a gloomy wood; it was here that True Thomas beheld
      things unseen by mere mortal eye. <span class="pagenum">218</span><a

    <p>
      And, a hundred years ago and more, did not a hare actually produce its
      young on the shattered, grass-grown hearth-stone of the Rhymer's dwelling?
      So everybody believed. But if doubt yet lingered anywhere regarding some
      portion of True Thomas's story, it was easily set at rest by the words cut
      on that old stone built into the wall ot the church at Earlston.

      it says; and somehow it gave one a peg to hang one's faith upon. The
      whole, or at least a sufficient part of it, is quite real in that
      countryside by the Rhymer's Glen where True Thomas lay "on Huntlie bank."
      and where flourished the Eildon Tree; and that True Thomas's still
      unfulfilled prophecies will yet one day come to pass, is a sound article
      of belief. Though how the ruthless prediction is to come about regarding
      the house of Cowdenknowes, (which is not far removed from the Rhymers old
      tower,) one does not quite see. But it was a doom<span class="pagenum">219</span><a
      name="link219" id="link219"></a> pronounced against a pitiless Home who
      there "had aince commanding." And the Homes are gone.

    <p>
      <br />

      Perhaps, too, that was not of True Thomas's foretelling. One prefers
      rather to think of Cowdenknowes in connection with the ballad:

      Tweed from a mile below Mertoun Bridge, up past the cauld where the pent
      water spouts and raves ceaselessly, along the bank where lies St. Boswells
      Golf Course, round that noble sweep where the river holds Dryburgh
      lovingly in the crook of its arm, up by the boulder-strewn streams above,
      and round the elbow by the foot suspension-bridge, past the lofty red
      scaurs and the hanging woods to the Monk's Ford, trout fishing&mdash;at
      least from the right bank&mdash;is free. And though it goes without saying
      that pool and stream are "sore fished," yet it is not possible by fair
      angling to spoil Tweed. Many a fisher may depart, empty and downcast, but
      if he persevere, some day he shall have his reward. To him who patiently
      teaches himself to know the river and the whims of its inhabitants, to him
      who studies weather and time of day&mdash;or, may be, of night&mdash;there
      must at length come success, for many are the trout, and large. The writer
      has known a yellow trout of 8 lbs. 12 ozs. to be killed with fly hard by
      the golf course. The weight is of course exceptional, but many a beauty of
      2 lbs. and over is there to be taken by him who is possessed of skill and
      patience; and to me is known no more enticing spectacle than one of these
      long swift pools of a summer evening, in the gloaming, when the water is
      alive with the dimples of rising trout.

      Let him climb, in the peaceful evening light, to the top of the red and
      precipitous Braeheads behind the long single street of St. Boswells Green,
      pleasantest of villages, and there gaze his fill at the beautiful Abbey
      far beneath his feet, sleeping amongst the trees across the river. Or let
      him go farther still, up by the leafy path that overhangs the rushing
      water, till he come to the little suspension-bridge. And let him stop
      there, midway across, and face towards the western sky and the three peaks
      of Eildon that stand out beyond the trees clear-cut against the warm
      after-glow. At his feet, mirroring the glory of the dying day, a broad
      shining sweep of quiet water broken only by the feeding trout; on his left
      hand, high in air the young moon floating like lightest feather; above the
      fretful murmur of some far-off stream, a bird piping to his mate. And over
      all, a stillness that holds and strangely moves the very soul. I think
      that if there be one with him attuned to his mood, an hour may pass and
      the gloaming have deepened almost to dusk, and neither of them shall have
      spoken a word, or noticed that the time has sped. And still they will

      At Leaderfoot the river is crossed by two stone bridges, one, the lofty
      naked viaduct of the Berwickshire Railway; the other, older and more
      pleasing, carries the picturesque road that, breaking out from the leafy
      woods of Drygrange and leaving on its left hand the hallowed site of Old
      Melrose, leads past St. Boswell's Green and the Kennels of the Buccleuch
      Hunt, over by Lilliard's Edge to Jedburgh. Between, and immediately above,
      the bridges at Leaderfoot are some glorious salmon casts, where nigh on a
      century ago Scrope was wont to throw a fly. Strange that during twenty
      years, in all that magnificent water fished by him, from Kelso to
      Caddonfoot, he never once landed a salmon of thirty pounds, and but few as
      heavy as twenty. There may have been more fish in his day,&mdash;one
      cannot judge; they got more, but then they took them not only with fly,
      but by "sunning" and by "burning" the water, and by many another means
      that now is justly considered to be poaching. But they seldom caught a
      salmon approaching in weight those which are now commonly taken in Tweed
      every season. Thirty pounds is a weight by no means noticeable now-a-days,
      and scarcely a year passes that fish of forty pounds and over are not
      taken by some fortunate angler; even above Melrose cauld, an obstruction
      that checks the ascent of many big fish, they have been got, far up the
      river, as heavy as thirty-eight pounds. Floors Water, at Kelso, I believe
      holds the record as regards size; in 1886 a fish of fifty-seven and a half
      pounds was captured. And as to numbers, though it is of course possible to
      labour for a week or more in Tweed&mdash;as elsewhere&mdash;even with the
      water apparently in good order, and with plenty of fish up, fresh from the
      sea, and meet with no manner of success, on the other hand there is on
      Makerstoun Water the pleasing record of twelve, fourteen, fifteen and
      sixteen salmon killed by one rod on four consecutive days; fifty seven
      fish in all, and <span class="pagenum">223</span><a name="link223"

      And in a similar period in November, 1903, Upper and Lower Floors Water
      produced between them one hundred and forty-three fish, the average weight

      away, across green fields, lies the venerable abbey, dreaming in the
      sunshine&mdash;"thy ruins mouldering o'er the dead." And, up stream, the
      distant belching chimneys of Galashiels cause one fervently <span
      class="pagenum">225</span><a name="link225" id="link225"></a>to thank
      Heaven that beside the old monastic pile there are no tweed mills to foul

      Mercifully, as regards trade, it is still at Melrose as it was when the
      "solemn steps of old departed years" paced through the land with youthful
      vigour. The little town is yet guiltless of modern iniquities&mdash;except
      as regards the railway and the inevitable Hydropathic, both of which are
      no doubt necessary evils (or blessings?) of these latter days. And except,
      also, that the modern villa is overmuch in evidence. A hundred years ago,
      when there was little of a town but the open Market Place hedging round
      the Old Cross of Melrose, it must have been a better, or at least a more
      picturesque place. On to the Abbey itself now the town's houses jostle,
      treading on its skirts, pertly encroaching. Therefore it lacks the charm
      and solitude of Dryburgh. Yet is its own charm irresistible, its beauty

      To the halting pen, it is the indescribable. In the deathless lines of the
      Wizard himself, its beauty lives to all time. But a thousand years of
      purgatory might not suffice to wipe from their Record of Sin the guilt
      <span class="pagenum">227</span><a name="link227" id="link227"></a>incurred
      by Hertford, and Evers, and Laiton, in 1544 and 1545 when they wantonly
      profaned and laid waste this dream in stone and lime, wrought by "some
      fairy's hand." Nor in later days were our own people free from offence in
      this respect. The number of old houses in the immediate neighbourhood is
      probably very small into which have not been built stones from the ruined
      abbey. Even across the river they are found; in the walls of a mouldering
      old farm house there, pulled down but a few years ago, were discovered
      many delicate bits of scroll work and of finely chiselled stone.

      A mile to the west of Melrose lies the village of Darnick. Here is a fine
      old tower dating from the sixteenth century, the property still of the
      family that originally built it. Fain would Sir Walter Scott have bought
      this picturesque old building after he moved to Abbotsford, and many
      another has looked on it with longing eyes, but no offer has succeeded in
      divorcing it from the stock of the original owner, though the surrounding
      lands have melted away. Somewhere about 1425 a Heiton built the earliest
      tower. That, naturally, could not stand against the all-destroying hand of
      Hertford in 1544, but the Heiton's descendant repaired, or rebuilt, it in
      1569, and ever since it has remained in the possession of the family,
      still, I believe, is occasionally inhabited by them. It is now probably
      the finest existing specimen of the old bastel-house. From its watch-tower
      may be had a glimpse of Tweed at Bridgend, where Father Philip, Sacristan
      of St. Mary's, took his involuntary bath. This is the Bridgend mentioned
      in Sir Walter's Notes to <i>The Monastery</i>. The ancient and very
      peculiar bridge over Tweed which gave to the hamlet its name is described
      in the text of the novel. There is now no trace of such a bridge, but in
      the early part of the eighteenth century the pillars yet stood. They are
      described in Gordon's <i>Itnerarium Septentrionale</i> (1726), and in
      Milne's account of the Parish of Melrose published in 1794, there is a
      full description. Those pillars yet stood, he says. "It has been a timber
      bridge; in the <span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228"
      id="link228"></a>middle pillar there has been a chain for a drawbridge,
      with a little house for the convenience of those that kept the bridge and
      received the custom.

      On this same pillar are the arms of <span class="pagenum">229</span><a
      name="link229" id="link229"></a>the Pringles of Galashiels." In Sir
      Walter's day, only the foundations of the piers existed. He tells how,
      "when drifting down the Tweed at night, for the purpose of killing salmon
      by torch light," he used to see them.

      A Heiton of Darnick fell at Flodden. His successor played no inconspicuous
      part in the bitter fight by his own tower side, on Skirmish Field, scene
      of that memorable encounter in 1526 between Angus and Huccleuch, when the
      stake was the person of the young king, James V. Turn-Again, too, is in
      the immediate neighbourhood, on the lands of Abbotsford, where the Scotts
      turned fiercely on their pursuers, and Ker of Cessford was slain. It is
      curious to note that beneath what is now a lawn at Darnick Tower many
      skeletons were dug up some years ago, and beside them were swords.
      Doubtless the skeletons were those of men slain in this fight; but why
      were their swords buried with them? Over the hill, at Holydene, an ancient
      seat of the Kers of Cessford, there was also unearthed years ago within
      the walls of the old castle, a gigantic skeleton, by its side a very
      handsome sword. Were their weapons, in the sixteenth century, laid
      convenient to the grasp of the dead warriors, as in Pagan times they were
      wont to be?

      Bowden Moor and Halidon are but over the hill from Darnick. It was from
      this direction, by the descent from Halidon (or Halyden, modern Holydene),
      that Buccleueh came down on Angus, after Cessford and Fernihirst and Home
      had ridden off. But the Homes and the Kers returned, and spoiled the play
      for the outnumbered Scotts.

      Less than a couple of miles to the west from Darnick, we come to that
      which Ruskin pronounced to be "perhaps the most incongruous pile that
      gentlemanly modernism ever designed." I fear that even the most devoted
      Borderer must admit that Abbotsford <i>is</i> an incongruous pile.
      Nevertheless it is hallowed ground, and one may not judge it by common
      standards. It reminds only of the gallantest struggle against hopeless
      odds that ever was made by mortal man; it speaks only of him whom everyone
      loved, and loves. "The glory-dies not, and the grief is past."

    <p>
      But what a marvellous change has been wrought over all <span
      class="pagenum">231</span><a name="link231" id="link231"></a>that
      countryside since "the Shirra" bought Abbotsford, a hundred and two years
      ago. Undrained, unenclosed, treeless and bare, covered for the most part
      only with its rough native heath&mdash;that was the character of the
      country. And the house; "small and poor, with a common <i>kail-yard</i> on
      one flank, and a staring barn on the other; while in front appeared a
      filthy pond covered with ducks and duckweed, from which the whole tenement
      had derived the unharmonious designation of Clarty Hole." It does not
      sound enticing; and already offers had been made to him of a property near
      Selkirk, where, among fields overhanging the river, was a site unsurpassed
      for natural beauty of prospect, whence Ettrick could be viewed winding
      past "sweet Bowhill," far into the setting sun. It was Erskine, I think,
      who urged him to buy this property&mdash;land which then belonged to the
      writer's grandfather and greatgrandfather. But it was too far from Tweed,
      Scott said; "Tweed was everything to him&mdash;a beautiful river, flowing
      broad and bright over a bed of milk-white pebbles," (pebbles, alas! that,
      there at least, are no longer milk-white, but rather grey with sewage
      fungus and the refuse of mills). In spite of all its manifest drawbacks,
      "Clarty Hole," appealed to Scott. It was near the beautiful old abbey, and
      the lands had been abbey-lands. An ancient Roman road led through the
      property from Eildon Hills to that ford over Tweed which adjorned the
      farm, (and with this ford for sponsor, he changed the name from "Clarty
      Hole" to "Abbot's Ford.") Over the river, on the rising ground full in his
      view was the famous Catrail; and through his own land ran the Rhymer's
      Glen, where True Thomas foregathered with the Queen of Faëry. Bit by bit,
      Scott added to his land, bit by bit to his cottage, regarding which his
      first intention was "to have only two spare bedrooms, with dressing-rooms,
      each of which will on a pinch have a couch-bed." And his tree-planting had
      begun at once. When the property was first acquired from the Reverend Dr.
      Douglas of Galashiels, there was on it but one solitary strip of <span
      class="pagenum">232</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>firs, so long
      and so narrow that Scott likened it to a black hair-comb.

      It ran," says Lockhart, "from the precincts of the homestead to near
      Turn-Again, and has bequeathed the name of <i>the Doctor's reiding-kame</i>
      to the mass of nobler trees amidst which its dark, straight line can now
      hardly be traced." I do not think that "the Doctor's redding-kame" now
      survives <span class="pagenum">233</span><a name="link233" id="link233"></a>as
      a name, even if the original trees be still to the fore. In any rase they
      would attract no attention, for what Sir Thomas Dick Lauder says was then
      "as tame and uninteresting a stretch of ground as could well be met with
      in any part of the world," is now rich in woods, and everywhere restful
      and pleasing to the eye&mdash;though it may be conceded that Galashiels
      has stretched a villa-bedecked arm farther up Tweed's left bank than might
      have been quite acceptable to Sir Walter.

      At Boldside, of whose "ruined and abandoned churchyard" he writes in his
      introduction to the <i>Monastery</i>, there is now a railway station, and
      suburban villas, large and small, dot the landscape ever the more
      plentifully as one approaches that important manufacturing town which a
      century back was but a tiny village peopled by a few industrious weavers.
      No longer, I fear, can it be said that Boldside's "scattered and detached
      groves," combining with "the deep, broad current of the Tweed, wheeling in
      moonlight round the foot of the steep bank.... fill up the idea which one
      would form in imagination for a scene that Obcron and Queen Mab might love
      to revel in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fairy Folk have fled from scenes tainted by an atmosphere of railway
      and modern villa. Even the Water-bull has ceased to shake the hills with
      his roar around Sir Walter's "small but deep lake" at Cauldshiels. Yet as
      late as the time of our grandsires people told gravely how, one warm
      summer's day, a lady and her groom, riding by the sullen shore of this
      "lochan," ventured a little way from the edge in order to water their
      thirsty horses, and were immediately engulfed in the Kelpie's insatiable
      maw. If such a tragedy ever did happen, no doubt the explanation is simple
      enough. Without any warning the hard upper crust would give way beneath
      the horses' feet, and, struggling vainly, they would sink in the
      fathomless, spewing, inky slime below. Once trapped in that, no power on
      earth could ever bring them out <span class="pagenum">234</span><a
      name="link234" id="link234"></a>again, dead or alive. A like fate nearly
      befell the writer when fishing alone one day in a gloomy, forsaken,
      kelpie-haunted Border hill loch. Dense fog came down, wreathing over the
      quiet water, hiding the dripping heather and the benty hill. A bird of the
      bittern kind boomed dismally at intervals, and a snipe bleated. It was a
      cheerless prospect; and the temperature had fallen with the coming of the
      fog. But through the mist could be heard the sound of trout rising in the
      little loch, and one bigger than his fellows persisted in rising far out.
      The sound was too tempting. The fisher waded out, and still out; and ever
      the big trout rose, luring him on. Another step, and another; it was no
      longer stony under foot, and the bottom began to quake, Still the footing
      was hard enough, and nothing happened; and again the big fish rose just
      out of casting distance. One more step would do it; and what danger could
      possibly be added in so small a distance? So one more step was taken, and&mdash;without
      a second's warning the crust broke. Only one thing saved the fisher;
      instinctively, as he sank through the fetid slime, he threw himself on his
      back, striking vigorously with his arms. But it took many an agonised,
      almost despairing, stroke ere his legs <i>sucked</i> out of that death
      trap. Nor, as long as there was water shoreward deep enough to swim in,
      did he again attempt to wade. His rod had not been abandoned&mdash;which
      was matter for gratulation; but, soaked to the skin, chilled to the very
      marrow, and reeking with the stench of putrid swamp, it was no thing of
      joy that day to make his devious way home over an unfamiliar hill that was
      wrapped in impenetrable folds of dense mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an origin, likely enough, for the Water-Bull. A great volume of
      marsh-gas, bursting from the bottom of a swampy loch, might be seen some
      still, foggy day, or in the uncertain evening light, suddenly to boil up
      on the surface far out. The wallowing upheaval caused by the belching gas
      would readily suggest the part-seen back or side of some formless monster,
      whose gambols were agitating the water and <span class="pagenum">235</span><a
      name="link235" id="link235"></a>causing billows to surge upon the
      weed-fringed shore; and a bittern's hollow boom quivering on the still
      night air, would easily be construed by the credulous and ignorant as the
      bellow of this fearsome monster that they thought they had seen wheeling
      and plunging. If he was anything more substantial than gas, what a beast
      he would have been to troll for!

      It is only a little above "the holy fane of Melrose" that there enters
      Tweed on the northern side an interesting little burn, the Ellwand, or
      Allen. Up the glen&mdash;the Fairy Dene, or Nameless Dene&mdash;formed by
      this stream, lies Glendearg, the tower described in the opening scenes of
      the <i>Monastery</i>. There are, in fact, three towers in the glen,
      Hillslap (now called Glendearg), Colmslie, and Langshaw. Over the door of
      the first is the date 1595, and the letters N. C. and E. L., the initials
      of Nicolas Cairncross and his wife. Colmslie belonged to the family of
      Borthwick; their crest, a Goat's Head, is still on the <span
      class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236" id="link236"></a>ruin,&mdash;or
      was some years ago. But who in old days owned Langshaw is not known to me.
      For mutual protection, Border towers were very commonly built thus, in
      groups of three&mdash;as is instanced, indeed, at the neighbouring village
      of Darnick, where formerly, besides the present existing bastel-house,
      there stood two others. "In each village or town," says Sir Walter, "were
      several small towers, having battlements projecting over the side-walls,
      and usually an advanced angle or two with shot-holes for flanking the door
      way, which was always defended by a strong door of oak, studded with
      nails, and often by an exterior grated door of iron. These small peel
      houses were ordinarily inhabited by the principal feuars and their
      families; but, upon the alarm of approaching danger, the whole inhabitants
      thronged from their own miserable cottages, which were situated around, to
      garrison these points of defence. It was then no easy matter for a hostile
      party to penetrate into the village, for the men were habituated to the
      use of bows and fire arms, and the towers being generally so placed that
      the discharge from one crossed that of another, it was impossible to
      assault any of them individually."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nameless Dene is famed for the "fairy" cups and saucers that are still
      to be found in the streamlet's bed after a flood, little bits of some sort
      of soft limestone which the washing of the water has formed into shapes so
      fantastic and delicate that one hardly needs the imagination of childhood
      to believe they are the work of fingers more than mortal. Up this valley
      ran the ancient Girthgate, a bridle-way over the hills used of old by the
      infrequent traveller, and always by the monks of Melrose when duty took
      them to visit the Hospital which Malcolm IV founded in. 1164 on Soltre, or
      Soutra, Hill. As late as the middle of last century the grassy track was
      plainly to be seen winding through the heather; perhaps in parts it is not
      even yet obliterated. Nature does not readily wipe out those old paths and
      drove roads that the passing of man and beast traced across the hills many
      centuries back.

      CHAPTER IX GALASHIELS AND THE GALA, LINDFAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd now we come to
      a once beautiful stream, of which, in the present condition of its lower
      stretches, it is not easy to speak with due moderation.

    <p>
      It is not the Tweed at Ashiesteel, however, that in this instance is
      injured, but the Gala at Galashiels, and Tweed below that town. "It
      would," says the Official Report issued in 1906 by H.M. Stationery Office,
      "be impossible to find a river more grossly polluted than the Gala as it
      passes through Galashiels,"&mdash;a verdict with which no wayfarer along
      the banks of that dishonoured stream will be inclined to disagree. The
      grey-blue liquid that sluggishly oozes down the river's bed among stones
      thick-coated with sewage fungus, is an outrage on nature most saddening to
      look upon. He does wisely who stands to windward of the abomination. It is
      true that of late years much has been done, much money spent, in the
      praiseworthy effort to bring purity into this home of the impure; but to
      the lay eye improvement is yet barely perceptible. "Fools and bairns,"
      however, they tell us, "should never see half-done work." The filter-beds
      of the extensive sewage works <span class="pagenum">238</span><a
      name="link238" id="link238"></a>are said to be not yet in working order,
      and so one may not despair of even yet living long enough to see Gala as
      Gala should be.

    <p>
      In the meantime, and till the entire sewage scheme is in full working
      order, there are&mdash;if one may judge from reports in the daily Press,&mdash;a
      few minor improvements not quite out of reach of the inhabitants. On 15th
      July, 1912, an evening paper published the account of "another" dead pig
      which at that date was lying in the river "immediately in front of the
      main entrance to the Technical College." The carcase, we are told, was
      "much decomposed, and attracted huge swarms of flies." This paper, in
      commenting on the corpse of an earlier defunct pig, which a few days
      before had reposed in the same tomb, remarks that "it has been the custom
      up to now for all kinds of objectional matter to be deposited on the river
      banks or thrown into the bed of the river to await the first flood to
      carry it down to the Tweed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The river," the journal continues, <span class="pagenum">239</span><a
      name="link239" id="link239"></a>"is at present at its lowest summer ebb,
      and during the heat wave the smells arising from decomposing matter have
      been overpowering." In an arctic climate, there may perhaps be some excuse
      for the proverb: "the clarder the cosier," but it seems scarcely
      applicable to Gala; and there might, one would imagine, be other and more
      modern methods of dealing with decomposed pigs than that of floating them
      into outraged Tweed. The condition of "fishes that tipple in the deep" and
      quaff cerulean dyes in every stream, is not likely to be improved by a
      diet of sewage fungus and decayed pig, any more than is the health of
      human dwellers by the banks likely to benefit by the proximity of
      decomposing animal matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Galashiels is mainly industrial, mainly the history of
      the'"Tweed" trade. There were mills of a sort in the town as early as
      1622, but even a hundred and fifty years later the trade cannot have
      greatly harmed the river; only 170 cwt. of wool were then used in all the
      mills of Galashiels, and there was no such thing as the manufacture of
      modern "tweeds." All the wool then used was made into blankets, and
      "Galashiels Greys," (whatever fearful fowl <i>they</i> may have been). The
      term "tweeds" came later, one is given to understand, and arose through
      the mistake of an English correspondent of one of the Galashiels
      manufacturers. This gentleman misread a letter, in which the Scottish
      writer spoke of his "tweels." The Englishman, having read the letter
      somewhat carelessly, and knowing that Galashiels was somewhere near the
      river Tweed, hastily concluded that the goods under discussion were termed
      "tweeds," and gave his order accordingly. The name was universally adopted
      in the trade, and now&mdash;as the professional cricketer said about
      "yorkers,"&mdash;"I don't see what else you <i>could</i> call them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Galashiels has a tradition to which it clings, that it was once a royal
      hunting seat. Mr. Robert Chambers says that the lodge or tower used by the
      Scottish monarchs when they came here a-hunting was pulled down only so
      recently as about the <span class="pagenum">240</span><a name="link240"
      id="link240"></a>year 1830. It was called the Peel, a strong square tower
      with small windows, "finer in appearance than any other house in the whole
      barony, that of Gala alone excepted." From it a narrow lane called the
      King's Shank led to the town. I cannot say it the name survives in
      Galashiels.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is another tradition in which perhaps Galashiels takes greater
      pride, the tradition connected with the plum tree in the Town's Arms.
      (Though what the little foxes are doing at the foot of the tree, and what
      they have to do with the legend, none can say. Perhaps they are English
      foxes; and they got the plums&mdash;sour enough, as it turned out.) The
      incident commemorated is said to be this: During one of the invasions of
      Edward III, a party of his soldiers had taken up their quarters in
      Galashiels. The country no doubt had been pretty well harried and laid
      waste&mdash;Edward's men had plenty of practice&mdash;and they may have
      been careless, with the carelessness begotten of overconfidence. Anyhow,
      they straggled through the? woods, looking for wild plums, the story goes&mdash;though
      one would imagine that the only plums they would be likely to find there
      would be sloes, not a fruit that one would expect to tempt them far
      afield. But perhaps, as some say, they were robbing an orchard&mdash;if
      there were orchards in Scotland in the fourteenth century. In any case, a
      party of Scots, either a passing armed band, or, as Galashiels would fain
      believe, the inhabitants of the town themselves, swearing that they would
      give the southern swine sourer plums than any that had yet set their teeth
      on edge, fell on the English, drove them in headlong rout to the banks of
      Tweed opposite to where Abbotsford now stands&mdash;the Englishmen's Dyke,
      they call the spot&mdash;and slew them to a man. "Soor Plums in
      Galashiels" has for centuries been a favourite air in the town, though the
      words of the song have perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gala as a stream has been badly misused by man&mdash;at and below the town
      poisoned by sewage and mill refuse, above the town overfished, and
      poached, almost to the extinction of its <span class="pagenum">241</span><a
      name="link241" id="link241"></a>trout. Matters now, however, are, I
      believe, vastly improved as regards sport; the Galashiels Angling
      Association works with &amp; will to make things what they should be in a
      stream once so famed, and one hears that its efforts are meeting with the
      success they deserve. But it can never come back to what it must have been
      "lang syne," say in Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's day.

      That gentleman records that he and a friend fished one day from Bankhouse
      down to Galashiels, and turning there, fished Gala up to its junction with
      the Ermit Burn, then followed the latter to its source on Soutra Hill, and
      found at the end of the day that they had filled three creels; their total
      catch was over thirty-six dozen trout. A good many were caught in the burn
      with worm, of course, and most of the trout taken were probably very
      small, but it shows what possibilities these small Border streams might
      hold if they were well treated. Nobody, however, one may hope&mdash;no
      reasonable mortal out of his teens, that is&mdash;now wants to catch over
      four hundred trout in a single day under any circumstances. Even to the
      very juvenile schoolboy there can be but the very minimum of sport in
      jerking fingerings on to the bank. If a fixed limit of size could be
      imposed; if the close<span class="pagenum">242</span><a name="link242"
      id="link242"></a> season were continued for another fortnight or three
      weeks in Spring; and, above all, if the sale of trout could be prohibited
      by law until at least the beginning of April, our Border fishing would be
      improved beyond recognition. Great takes are made now, with worm, early in
      the season, when the waters are discoloured and the trout lean and
      ravenous; and long before they are in anything like condition either to
      give sport or to be decently fit for food, vast quantities of fish from
      the Border streams are sent off to the English markets. If those markets
      were kept closed a few weeks longer, many a trout would have a chance to
      reach maturity that is now sacrificed in extreme youth to put a few
      "bawbees" into a poacher's pocket. The great takes at the season's opening
      are not made by fair fishing. The writer was informed, three or four years
      ago, by the solitary porter of a very small Tweed-side railway station&mdash;himself
      a keen and skilful fisher&mdash;that on 2nd March of that year two men had
      consigned to Manchester from that one little station <i>one hundred and
      ten pounds weight</i> of trout. How were <i>they</i> caught? Certainly not
      by fair means. They are not <i>fishers</i> who take trout after this
      fashion. These are the men who, to suit their immediate wants and their
      own convenience, would deplete every stream in the Border and put a speedy
      end to all sport. As things are at present there is practically nothing to
      prevent them from taking what they please from any water.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, to return to Gala. Here, as everywhere in the Border, vast are
      the changes that the past sixty or seventy years have wrought on the face
      of nature. Even at a time so comparatively recent as that when the present
      North British line of railway from Edinburgh to Carlisle was being
      constructed down the valley, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder remarks on the
      revolution that in his own experience a few years had made. "We know of no
      district," says he, "which has been so com<span class="pagenum">243</span><a
      name="link243" id="link243"></a>pletely metamorphosed since the days of
      our youth as that of Gala Water." In his boyhood, the whole wore a
      pastoral character. Crops were rare, and fences hardly to be met with.

      Not a tree was to be seen, except in the neighbourhood of one or two old
      places, and especially at and around Torwoodlee and Gala House, near the
      mouth of the river. Everything within sight was green, simple, and bare.
      Then he contrasts <span class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244"
      id="link244"></a>this with the appearance of the valley at date of his
      writing, when "the whole country is fenced, cultivated, and hedged round.
      Thriving and extensive plantations appear everywhere."

      Could he see it, he would find the change even more marked now, with the
      "thriving plantations" grown and extended, countless trains thundering up
      and down the line day and night, and above all with his little village of
      "two thousand two hundred and nine inhabitants" grown into a great and
      busy town.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ancient days, this valley through which Gala flows was called Wedale,&mdash;the
      Dale of Woe, the Valley of Weeping, for here says Professor Skene, was
      fought one of King Arthur's great battles against the Pagans. At what is
      now the village of Stow&mdash;the Stow (old English, "place,") of Wedale&mdash;the
      Bishops of St. Andrews had a palace; and here, by the Lady well at
      Torsonce, stood in Arthurian days a church famed for its possession of
      fragments of the True Cross, bestowed, it was <span class="pagenum">245</span><a
      name="link245" id="link245"></a>said, by King Arthur himself.

      Here, too, were preserved in great veneration, long years after Arthur had
      passed away "to be king among the dead," portions of that miraculous image
      of the Blessed Virgin which, the old historian Nennius tells us, the king
      bore into the stress of battle that day among the hills of Wedale. And
      here, till about 1815, lay a very large stone on whose face was the well
      marked impression of a foot, said by tradition to have been the imprint of
      the foot of the Virgin. To be converted into road-metal has doubtless been
      its fate. There are still, I believe, in Stow, the remains of a very old
      church, not, however, those of the original church of Wedale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Galashiels by road past Boldside, with a glimpse of the Eildons
      and Abbotsford to the left, three miles from the town and immediately
      above the junction of Tweed with its tributary the Ettrick we cross the
      former river. Hard by, to the right, in a wood on top of Rink Hill, are
      the remains of a very fine British camp. <span class="pagenum">246</span><a
      name="link246" id="link246"></a>Here for the time we again quit the banks
      of Tweed, and proceed up Ettrick. A mile from the junction of the rivers,
      we pass near the old churchyard of Lindean, where once stood the ancient
      church in which, the night after his assassination in 1353, lay the bloody
      corpse of Sir William Douglas, the Knight of Liddesdale, slain by his
      kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with this churchyard, there used to exist a belief that
      greatly troubled the minds of country folk in the surrounding district.
      Away back in those evil times when the Plague raged through Scotland, very
      many of its victims were buried in a common grave in Lindean churchyard.
      But the church was demolished after the Reformation, and the churchyard
      gradually fell out of use as a place of burial. There came a time when the
      people had no farther need for it; why, thought some practical person,
      should it not be ploughed up and cultivated? There was but one thing that
      saved it from this fate;&mdash;not reverence for the ashes of the rude
      forefathers of the hamlet that lay here at rest, but the sure and certain
      belief in the minds of their descendants that in the event of the soil
      being disturbed, there must inevitably be a fresh outbreak of the dreaded
      Plague. It is curious and interesting to read of the blind horror with
      which our ancestors in their day regarded this scourge; but their horror
      is not hard to understand. Sanitation did not exist in those times,
      medicine as a science was impotent to curb the ravages of the dreaded
      pestilence. The people were helpless; to save themselves there remained
      only flight. And in what remote spot might flight avail them in a
      Plague-swept land! In that outbreak during the seventeenth century,
      temporary houses, or shelters, were erected in many parts of the Border,
      and into them were hurried persons smitten by the pestilence&mdash;and
      often, no doubt, persons suffering from some very minor ailment which
      their panic-stricken neighbours diagnosed as Plague. It is not to be
      supposed that once there, they would get much, if any, attention; they
      would simply take their <span class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247"
      id="link247"></a>chance&mdash;a slender one&mdash;of recovery. And if they
      died, so great was the dread in the minds of the living that, in many
      instances, to save unnecessary risk, the authorities merely pulled down
      the building over the dead bodies, and heaped earth on top. At a period
      even so late as in the writer's boyhood, there were many spots&mdash;perhaps
      in very remote districts there may yet be a few&mdash;where the Plague was
      said to be buried, and where to disturb the soil was believed to be a
      matter of extreme danger; the pestilence, like some malevolent fiend long
      held down, would inevitably break loose, and again Grim Death would hurl
      his darts broadcast at old and young, rich and poor. In his <i>Scenes of
      Infancy</i> Leyden alludes to the belief:

      All manner of precautions were adopted to hinder the spreading of the
      pestilence. Orders were even issued forbidding the assembling together of
      more than three or four persons at any one place, but the Privy Council
      Records of the time show that this regulation was obeyed only when it
      suited the people to observe it. There were limits to the dread in which
      the pestilence was held, and even fear of the consequences did not always
      reconcile the Borderers to such an interference with their liberty. It is
      on record that, in 1637, when, in the execution of his duty as Convener of
      the Justices of his county, Sir John Murray of Philiphaugh went to
      Selkirk, he <span class="pagenum">248</span><a name="link248" id="link248"></a>found
      that a marriage was about to take place, and that most part of the
      community had been invited to be present. Sir John at once forbade the
      assemblage, and, later, he sent for the father of the bride, a man named
      James Murray, and informed him that on no account would more than four or
      five guests be permitted. But James was not to be thus coerced. "Na, na!"
      he cried, "If ye be feared, come not there. But the folk are comin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Sir John called on the bailies to commit the offender at once to
      prison. The bailies, however, were probably included in the number of the
      wedding guests, and were looking forward to the "ploy" with as great
      pleasurable anticipation as was even the most irresponsible of those
      invited. They paid no heed to Sir John's demand; "there was no obedience
      given thereto," say the Records. And next day, when the postponed wedding
      took place, "there was about four or five score persons who met and drank
      together all that day till night." Whether Sir John remained to take any
      part in the festivities we are not told, but of this at least we may be
      very sure: his interference did not tend to lessen the amount of liquor
      consumed on the occasion.

      class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a> miles up the
      river from Lindean you come to Selkirk. But this is not the route by which
      that town should be approached; by the Galashiels road, one is in the
      heart of Selkirk almost before one is aware of any streets. To see
      properly the old royal burgh clinging to the steep side of its hill, and
      to realise the beauty of its situation, it is necessary to come from
      Galashiels up Tweed by the road diverging at Rink. Thence cross Yair
      Bridge, go by that beautiful highway through the shaggy woods of
      Sunderland Hall, past Ettriek-bank and the Nettley Burn, down by Linglie,
      across Ettrick by the old bridge, and so up into the Market Place of
      Selkirk by the Green, (which is not anything in the nature of a lawn, but,
      on the contrary, a rather steep road).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a route longer, but to those not pressed for time, one infinitely
      more pleasant and beautiful than the direct way between the two towns. By
      it you see the exquisite bit of Tweed valley that lies between the
      junction and Yair Bridge, and, pausing as you cross that bridge, you have
      on either hand a prospect infinitely fair of heathery hill, green, leafy
      wood, and glorious river, the latter, above you on the right, hurrying
      down from Yair Cauld, a glittering sheet of eddying water, sweeping in
      magnificent curve past its elms at the foot of a mighty tree-clad brae;
      then passing beneath your feet, chafing and hoarsely roaring, it plunges
      through between imprisoning rocks, till once more comparative peace is
      gained in reaches dear to the heart of salmon fishers.<span class="pagenum">250</span><a
      name="link250" id="link250"></a> Then you leave the bridge at Yair, and
      climbing an easy gradient, pass along by a pleasant, shady road through
      rich woods, over the hill to Ettriekbank, where tradition says Queen Mary
      crossed the Ettrick on her way to Jedburgh in 1566.

    <p>
      In itself, Ettriekbank possesses no feature of interest, but it recalls to
      mind the fact that here, in 1818, two harmless-looking hawkers with a cart
      were wont to call at intervals, ostensibly to sell fish. Had their real
      errand been known, it is little fish they would have sold, and short would
      have been their shrift at the hands of the roused and horrified
      country-folk. They were Burke and Hare, the notorious body-snatchers, and
      the real purpose of the cart in which they brought fish was to carry back
      to Edinburgh the bodies they might procure in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke and Blare! Still, after the lapse of close on a century their memory
      is held in execration in the Border, still is their name a kind of vague
      horror even to those to whom it may convey little else, and who are almost
      wholly ignorant of what hideous crimes were committed by the pair. It was,
      of course, not only <i>dead</i> bodies that they took. These they ravished
      from new made graves; but they took also living men, drugged or filled
      with drink, and murdered them for the sake of the price their corpses
      would bring as subjects for dissection by some of the doctors of that day.
      Hare turned king's evidence. After the trial and execution of his
      accomplice, he was smuggled away to the United States. There his identity
      was discovered, and an infuriated mob threw him into a limekiln, where he
      was badly burned and his eye sight destroyed. After a time, when the rage
      and horror aroused by his misdeeds might to some extent be supposed likely
      to have died away, he returned to England, and as late as 1855 he was
      alive and in London. A blind, white haired, frouzy, ragged old man, led by
      a dog, used daily to slouch up Oxford Street, turn at the Circus towards
      Portland Place, post himself near where the Langham Hotel stands, and beg
      there from charitable passers-by. How many of them would have given, had
      they known that this old man was Hare, a ruffian stained with the blood of
      perhaps half a score of victims? How many of them, shrinking aside, would
      have stepped into the foulest gutter rather than be contaminated by even
      brushing against the hem of his filthy old garments? Few then knew who he
      was; but there are men yet alive who may possibly remember having seen
      him. An eminent London surgeon, who died, comparatively speaking, but the
      other day, very well remembered, and occasionally spoke of, the grizzly
      old ruffian who stood, with tapping stick, holding a bowl for alms. The
      late Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, too, in his <i>Reminiscences</i> describes
      the appearance of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after passing Ettriekbank, the road, coming <span
      class="pagenum">252</span><a name="link252" id="link252"></a>suddenly out
      from a clump of trees, breaks into view of a wide and pleasant valley,
      with a goodly prospect of wood and heathery hill stretched far to the west
      and south. Down this valley sweeps the gravelly bed of Ettrick; on its
      farther bank, on the flat haugh, stand a long line of mills and the
      station of a branch line of railway. Above, rising abruptly, tier upon
      tier in cheerful succession, trees and houses that blend into the smiling
      face of Selkirk. And perhaps it is by reason of the width of the setting
      in which they are placed, or because down the mighty funnel of the valley
      comes rushing the west wind that sweeps all smoke away, but somehow it
      seems that the mills on the haugh below the town give no air of squalor or
      of dirt to the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would that one could say the same with regard to the effect of their dyes
      and refuse on the condition of the river. By a steep red "scaur" below
      Linglie there once was a pool clearer than amber, across which in summer
      weather small boys, breathless but greatly daring, essayed to swim.
      Farther down, at the back of Lindean Flour Mill, was another, where in the
      long twilights of June,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ". . trout beneath the blossom'd tree,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Plashed in the golden stream,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and whence many a pounder and half-pounder was drawn by eager young
      fishers. Where is that seductive amber-clear water now? Alas! in these
      days it is of a sickly blue tint, smelling evilly; and the stones in its
      bed, that once were a clear, warm grey, with yellow boulders interspersed
      that flashed in the stream of a sunny day like burnished copper,&mdash;they
      are slime-covered and loathsome, things to be shunned. Surely more can be
      done to check this pollution of our beautiful streams. So far as can be
      ascertained, there is but one of the mills of Selkirk that strives (and I
      believe it strives successfully,) so to deal with its refuse that the
      water it uses may be returned to Ettrick in a condition that does not
      defile that stream. <span class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253"
      id="link253"></a>Nevertheless, it has to be admitted that during the
      autumn floods salmon do run the gauntlet of Ettrick's lower reaches, and
      in countless numbers congregate below Selkirk Cauld (or weir), where the
      difficulty of ascent acts as a partial check on their continued migration.
      On a day in the month of November, if there should happen to be a
      considerable flood in the river, this cauld is a sight worth going a long
      way to look at. A wide rushing sea of tawny, foaming water&mdash;a hundred
      yards from bank to bank&mdash;races over the sloping face of the cauld,
      and, where it plunges into the deep pool at foot, rears itself in a mighty
      wave, with crest that tosses in the wintry breeze "like the mane of a
      chestnut steed." From daylight till dark you may watch the fish,&mdash;big
      and little, from the thirty-pound leviathan to the little one or two-pound
      sea trout&mdash;in their eagerness to reach the spawning-beds of the upper
      waters, hurl themselves high in air over this great barrier-wave, then,
      gallantly struggling, continue for a while their course up the rushing
      torrent, till gradually they lose way and come tumbling back, head over
      tail, into the pool from which half a minute before they had emerged. It
      is like standing by one of the jumps in an endless kind of tinny Grand
      National Steeple-chase; so many fish are in the air at once at any given
      moment that one becomes giddy with watching them. Probably a good many do
      in time accomplish the ascent, or perhaps get up by the salmon-ladders in
      mid-stream, but the great majority are swept back, over and over again.
      Those that make their attempt near the side, in the shallow water out of
      the main force of the current, are frequently taken in landing-nets (by
      water-bailiffs stationed there for the purpose), and are carried up and
      set at liberty in the smooth water above the cauld. It must be confessed
      that a considerable number are also taken in this way, or with the help of
      a "cleek," by poachers. The bailiffs cannot be everywhere; and a salmon is
      a temptation before which (in the Border) almost the most virtuous of his
      sex might conceivably succumb. The average <span class="pagenum">254</span><a
      name="link254" id="link254"></a>Borderer, indeed, I believe would
      cheerfully risk his life sometimes, rather than forego his chance of "a
      Fish."&mdash;"The only crime prevalent [in Selkirk] is that of poaching,"
      says the Rev. Mr. Campbell, minister of the parish for fifty years,
      writing in 1833. There was one, greatly sinning in this respect, of whom
      nevertheless, because of his gallant end, I cannot think without a feeling
      almost of affection. He&mdash;with a fish where no fish should have been&mdash;was
      hopelessly outmanoeuvred by the bailiffs, escape cut off on every side,
      and only the river, red, swollen, and cold as ice, open to him. "Here's
      daith or glory for Jockie!" he cried, and plunged into a torrent from
      which he came no more alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little higher up than the cauld is the Piper's Pool, where, until he was
      hit by a chance bullet that brought him rolling like a shot rabbit down
      the brae into the water, a piper stood piping that September morning of
      1645, when Montrose and Leslie were striving for the victory. On the bank
      above, those inhabitants of Selkirk who cared to run some risk&mdash;which
      was probably the whole community&mdash;took up their position and watched
      the fight as from a grand stand. There is no better vantage point
      imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie, I suppose, crossing opposite the gap called Will's Nick, (not far
      from Lindean), came up the left bank of Ettrick and, hidden by the fog,
      skirted along the edge of the hills till he was within striking distance
      of the Royal camp, when he took them, no doubt, both in flank and in rear.
      But how did a man of Montrose's experience allow himself to be thus
      fooled? Montrose passed the night in Selkirk, and he received no
      information whatever of any hostile movement. It was too late when he and
      what mounted men he could hastily collect came thundering and foaming
      through the shallow stream next morning, and went spurring over the flat
      haugh against the enemy. Someone besides Traquair must have played him
      false. It is inconceivable that he had no pickets out, or employed none of
      his cavalry on outpost duty. If they were <span class="pagenum">255</span><a
      name="link255" id="link255"></a>out, in spite of the fog they could not
      fail to have got in touch with some part of Leslie's force. No large body
      of troops could have come undetected by a route so obvious, if those on
      the look-out for them were doing their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selkirk on this occasion saw war, as it were from the dress circle. The
      town was burned to the ground by the English after Flodden, and at various
      other odd times, but I do not think that it ever saw much actual street
      fighting such as was the experience of Jedburgh again and again. Selkirk
      was out of the main current of invasion, and it was only odd "spates" that
      came her way, such as when, in 1304, Edward I passed through the town on
      his march back to England; and again when in 1309 Edward II, following an
      unexpected route to the north, took her on his way. Still, Selkirk had
      always been familiar with at least the pomp and circumstance of war. The
      town was old when Earl David founded its abbey in 1113; probably it had
      always been a headquarters of the Scottish Kings and their retinue, when
      hunting in the Forest. Certainly William the Lion, Alexander II, and
      Alexander III all passed a good deal of time in his castle, which of old
      stood on an eminence in what are now the grounds of Haining, near the
      "head" of the town. Probably the Court came here chiefly for the purpose
      of hunting; the Forest of Ettrick was famed for its deer, as its men&mdash;unlike
      the majority of their countrymen&mdash;were famed for their archery. At
      Falkirk, in 1298, the English themselves bore witness to the warlike
      prowess of the men of Selkirk, as well as to their stature and fine
      appearance. At Bannockburn the sons of the forest distinguished
      themselves. And again at Flodden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the part borne by her sons in the last-named great struggle,
      there are many trad-'fons to which the inhabitants of Selkirk cling
      tenaciously. Some, I fear, will not bear too close investigation,
      Traditions are mis-chancey things to handle; it does not always do to
      enquire too closely if one would retain one's faith. A large body of the
      men of <span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256" id="link256"></a>Selkirk
      and the Forest went to Flodden, and they fought as they always did fight.
      That much, at least, is certain. But who shall say how many returned from
      that fatal field? The Burgh Records are silent. There is a mournful gap of
      two months in the history of the town; not an entry of any sort for eight
      weeks in the autumn of 1513. And, says Mr. Craig-Brown in his History of
      Selkirkshire, "Quite as mournful and significant are the frequent services
      of heirs recorded after the battle." Selkirk suffered severely at Flodden.
      There, as elsewhere, her sons did their duty; and they fell gloriously.
      One could wish that that might suffice: it is an ungrateful task to rake
      among the dead cinders of time-honoured traditions. But it is the
      detestable habit of the day to leave none of our ancient beliefs
      unassailed: the more beloved the tradition, the more likely is some one to
      remain unsatisfied till he has upset it. Yet it must be admitted that few
      of our cherished legends emerge triumphant when assailed by the scoffer.
      That, for instance, of Fletcher and the English standard captured at
      Flodden, which has been revered in Selkirk by so many generations of
      Souters, I fear, when it is investigated, must crumble into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the tradition regarding the origin of the town's Arms is
      impossible of maintenance. The figures are so obviously those of the
      Virgin and Child; the halo and the glory round their heads forbid any
      other interpretation. But it is easy to imagine that after the Reformation
      no Scottish town would care to acknowledge any connection, however remote,
      with the detested Church of Rome. Hence probably the legend of the dead
      woman and her still living baby who were found at the Lady-wood Edge by
      the Selkirk survivors of Flodden. Such a body, of course, may quite
      possibly have been discovered, and the tradition would be used later to
      account for the figures that appear in the town's Arms. Just in the same
      way is a gargoyle in Melrose Abbey, beside the reputed grave of Michael
      Scott, now pointed out to <span class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257"
      id="link257"></a>American and English tourists as an authentic
      representation in stone of that mighty Wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the "Souters of Selkirk," there can be no proof either way; but I
      prefer to believe that the song is old, almost as old as Flodden. Perhaps
      I have misread Mr. Craig Brown, and am wrong in believing that he regards
      it as commemorating a famous football match played in 1815 between Souters
      and men under the leadership of Lord Home. If that were so, it could not
      have been sung at Dalkeith in 1804, when the Selkirkshire Yeomanry were
      present at a banquet there after the False Alarm. We read that Lord Home
      called for the song on that occasion, but that none of the Yeomanry cared
      to sing it before a man on whose ancestor it reflects, whereupon, amid
      rapturous applause, Lord Home sang it himself. If it refers to a football
      match, it must be to one of very ancient date, but one that surely could
      not fall to have left some mark on the minds of the Souters. Mr. Plummer,
      of Sunderland Hall, Sheriff Depute of the county prior to Sir Walter
      Scott, writing in 1793 says that though he had lived all his life within
      two miles of Selkirk and had known the song from his boyhood, there was
      not in his day, and he believed there never had been, any tradition
      connecting the song with anything of the nature of a football match. The
      verses may not have been written, probably were not written, immediately
      after the battle, but I am confident that it refers to Flodden&mdash;in
      spite of the fact that there was then no <i>Earl</i> of Home. No doubt the
      song has had variants from time, to time; probably there was no allusion
      to an "Earl" in the original verses. Popular calumny shortly after Flodden
      taxed Lord Home with having been the cause of James's defeat and death; he
      was unable, as we know, to come to his Sovereign's aid. This popular
      belief, coupled with the fact that Selkirks representatives suffered more
      cruelly than did Lord Home's men&mdash;-and therefore, of course local
      prejudice would infer, did their duty <span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>better&mdash;would be quite sufficient to
      give rise to the sentiment: "Down wi' the Merse to the Deil." In his
      letter of 1793, referred to above, Mr. Plummer says: "At election dinners,
      etc., when the Selkirk folks begin to get <i>fou'</i> they always call for
      music, and for that tune in particular. At such times I never heard a
      Souter hint at the football, but many times speak of the battle of
      Flodden." So far as it goes, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest a
      football origin for "The Souters of Selkirk."
    </p>
    <p>
      It has always seemed to me, (who, being a native, am on that account
      possibly no impartial witness,) that the people of Selkirk have ever
      possessed in greater degree than their neighbours the true Spirit of the
      Sportsman. Of the inhabitants of Yarrow and Selkirk, a seventeenth-century
      writer recorded that "they are ingenuous, and hate fraud and deceit; theft
      or robbery are not heard among them, and very rarely a Ly to be heard in
      any of their mouths, except among them of the baser sort." There has
      always been in them, I think, little of that "win, tie, or wrangle"
      disposition which is usually to be found among small communities; and they
      were never of the sort who "heave half a brick at the head" of the outland
      wayfarer. In their dealings with the French officers, prisoners of war on
      parole, who were quartered in the old town from 1811 to 1814, the Selkirk
      people displayed an admirable generosity and a gratifying amount of good
      feeling,&mdash;though in that respect none of our Border towns can be said
      to have been lacking. One of these French prisoners afterwards, when an
      old man, published most interesting reminiscences of his stay, and he
      writes of his involuntary hosts with appreciation, and almost with
      affection. In 1811, when the accumulation of prisoners of warm England had
      become very great, it was decided to distribute a large part of them
      throughout Scotland. To Selkirk, as its share, came a hundred and ninety
      men.
    </p>

      How it may be now, I cannot say, but in the writer's boyhood the memory of
      these prisoners still lived, and old people told <span class="pagenum">259</span><a
      name="link259" id="link259"></a>innumerable tales of the strange habits of
      "thae Frainch." "They made tea oot o' dried whun (furze) blossoms, an'
      they skinned the very paddas (frogs)," said one old man. The writer of the
      reminiscences referred to above makes no allusion to "paddas," but he does
      mention that "a lake in the neighbour hood supplied abundance of very
      delicate pike." This lake may have been the Haining Loch, a picturesque
      sheet of water over which, however, there is, or used to be, at times a
      nasty vegetable scum. "One of the most beautiful and peaceful lakes that
      ever was seen," is Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's description of it as it was in
      his day. I think, however, that the French writer probably refers to the
      Pot Loch, a small and once very deep lochan, or pond, nestling in a hollow
      at the foot of the pleasant heathery hills on which is now the Selkirk
      Golf Course. It is a much more likely spot than the Haining for the
      prisoners to frequent. The former is on the town's property, the latter on
      an estate in private hands. And in the former there are, or at least there
      certainly used to be, many pike of no great size. It was here, too, that
      tradition told us the prisoners went to catch frogs? That Frenchmen in
      their own land lived chiefly on a diet of frogs was the firm belief of a
      majority of the town's inhabitants, ("French frogs" of course was a term
      of contemptuous reproach,) and that the prisoners went to the Pot Loch for
      any other purpose than to obtain supplies of what seemed to the townsfolk
      to be a very loathsome dainty, would never occur to them. The fact that
      the edible frog did not exist there, would make no difference in their
      belief. That was no difficulty; frogs were frogs all the world over; and
      frogs of course included toads. The French ate them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer of the reminiscences, M. Doisy de Villargennes, tells us that
      some of the prisoners were "passionately fond of fishing, and excelled in
      it,"&mdash;national prejudice of course forbids that we should accept the
      latter part of the statement as correct!&mdash;and that they used to fish
      in Ettrick and <span class="pagenum">260</span><a name="link260"
      id="link260"></a>Tweed. Part of the former, close to the town, would be
      within their "bounds," but the Tweed is far outside the mile radius which
      was their limit of liberty.

      On every road, one mile from the town, was placed a post bearing the words
      "Limit of the Prisoners of War"; down the road which leads towards
      Bridgelands there is still a memorial of these unfortunates,&mdash;a thorn
      bush, called the Prisoner's Bush, which marked their limit in that
      direction. Any prisoner found outside the boundary was liable to be fined
      one guinea&mdash;a process, one would imagine, something akin in certain
      cases to getting blood from a stone&mdash;and the fine was supposed to go
      to the person who informed on the delinquent. To the credit of Selkirk it
      must be recorded that no one ever claimed this reward; even when a
      prisoner uprooted a notice post and carried it a mile farther along the
      road, it was, we are told, only "to the amusement of the inhabitants,"
      who, M. Doisy adds, "never on any occasion took advantage of a regulation
      ir virtue of which whoever might see us outside the fixed limits was
      entitled to one guinea, payable by the delinquent." He himself, he says,
      "frequently went fishing several miles down the Tweed," and <span
      class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261" id="link261"></a>was never
      fined, never in any way molested. In fact, great and small in Selkirk,
      from the Sheriff Depute of the county down to the town's bellman, and the
      "drucken" ne'er-do-weel who is to be found in every small town, and whom
      one would scarcely expect to be proof against a bribe that would provide
      him with the wherewithal for a royal spree, all combined to wink at these
      infringements of the regulations. Sir Walter himself, indeed, who was then
      living at Abbotsford, used frequently to have some of the prisoners to
      dine and spend the evening there. It is interesting to read the account of
      these visits, and to note how Sir Walter impressed his foreign visitors.
      Says the writer of the Reminiscences: "There was one person just at this
      time whom I did not then appreciate as I afterwards did&mdash;Sir Walter
      Scott, then plain Mr. Scott. Probably no one knew, unless his publishers,
      or ever suspected him of being 'The Great Unknown,' the author of
      'Waverley.' As for us we only saw in Mr. Scott, the Sheriff of
      Selkirkshire, a lawyer of some repute in Edinburgh. As sheriff be
      frequently came to Selkirk, he having his home at Abbotsford, little more
      than three miles distant from Selkirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Scott became acquainted with one of our comrades, named Tarnier, a
      young man of brilliant talent, excellent education, and of remarkably
      exuberant spirits. Shortly after, without the knowledge of the Government
      agent, or rather, with his tacit approval, Tarnier was invited to
      Abbotsford, and he gave us on his return a vivid description of his
      reception there. Later, probably at our countryman's suggestion, he was
      requested by Mr. Scott to bring with him three of his friends each time he
      was invited to dinner at Abbotsford. Thus I was present on two or three
      occasions, invited, not by the host himself, but by my comrade Tarnier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be, as far as I can remember, about the month of February, 1813,
      and our mode of procedure was as follows:&mdash;In the twilight, those who
      were invited repaired to the boundary the milestone already mentioned&mdash;there
      a carriage <span class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262" id="link262"></a>awaited
      us, which took us at a good pace to Abbotsford, where we were most
      graciously received by our host. We only saw Mrs. Scott during the few
      moments before the announcement of dinner, at which she was not present.
      Mrs. Scott was, as we supposed, French, or of French extraction; in fact,
      she spoke French perfectly: Mr. Scott had married her at Carlisle. Our
      host appeared to us in quite a different aspect to that under which we had
      known him passing in the streets of Selkirk. There he gave us the
      impression of being a cheery good-natured man, whose face was rather
      ordinary, and whose carriage somewhat common, and halting in his gait,
      this probably due to his lameness. At Abbotsford, on the contrary, we
      found him a gentleman full of cordiality and gaiety, receiving his guests
      in a fashion as amicable as it was delicate. The rooms were spacious and
      well lighted; the table, without being sumptuous, was on the whole <i>recherché</i>.
      One need not expect me to describe very exactly the surroundings of
      Abbotsford, as on the occasions I was privileged to be there, we arrived
      in the twilight, and we returned when it was quite dark by the same means
      of locomotion. Thus, with the exception of the dining room, and a short
      glimpse of the salon, all that I know about Abbotsford has been derived
      from publications which everyone has read. Neither should it be expected
      that I can give details of repasts to which I was invited sixty-five years
      ago. But the general theme of our conversation has remained Immutably
      fixed in my memory. The principal subject of our discussion did not
      ordinarily turn on politics, but on minute details concerning the French
      army. All that particularly referred to Napoleon, and above all, traits
      and anecdotes, appeared to interest our host in the highest degree, who
      always found the means, we observed, to bring round the conversation to
      this subject if it happened to have diverged in any way. As can be
      imagined, we took good care to repeat nothing unfavourable regarding the
      character of our beloved Emperor. We little suspected that our host was
      gathering material for a <span class="pagenum">263</span><a name="link263"
      id="link263"></a>work published ten years later under the title of 'A Life
      of Napoleon Bonaparte.'" That Sir Walter's estimate of the Emperor greatly
      displeased M. Doisy, goes almost without saying. It will be remembered,
      also, that the French General, Gourgaud, was so bitterly incensed by some
      statements in this book that a challenge to Sir Walter was fully expected;
      and assuredly it would have been accepted if given.

      Selkirk in the Time of the French prisoners was a small place of two
      thousand inhabitants or less, the houses nearly all picturesquely
      thatched, very few roofed with slate as at present. It must have been
      matter of no small difficulty in such a community suitably to house a
      sudden influx of strangers. Indeed there <i>was</i> very great difficulty,
      until it was discovered that the Frenchmen were to pay for their
      accommodation, and then the difficulty vanished. But it would be hard at
      the present day to find in Selkirk lodgings of any sort at the rate (2s.
      6d. a week) which then satisfied owners of houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is the French prisoner's description of Selkirk: "The town
      is encircled by beautiful hills on all sides: in the centre it had a large
      square adorned with a fountain; a very fine bridge crossed the Ettrick. An
      ordinary-looking building belonging to the National Church and a much
      larger one owned by the Presbyterians, or rather the sect known by the
      name of Anti-Burghers, who had for their pastor an excellent and venerable
      man named Lawson, were the only two buildings in Selkirk worthy of
      notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills are still beautiful; perhaps, owing to extensive tree planting,
      more beautiful now than then; still within a step of Selkirk is the purple
      heather, and the heartsease and blue-bell a-swing in the summer breeze;
      still on every side the view lies wide and glorious. And even in the
      winter, when snow first "grimes" the hills, or when the northern blast has
      wrapped them in its winding sheet, one can gaze, and repeat with heartfelt
      and perfect sincerity:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "By Yarrow's stream still let me stray,

    <p class="indent15">
      Though none should guide my feeble way;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Still feel the breeze down Ettrick break,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Although it chill my wither'd cheek."

      "In the centre it had a large square adorned with a fountain." The
      "square" of Selkirk is, in effect, a triangle, (in which now stands Sir
      Walter Scott's monument,) but as to the "fountain," I should have doubts;
      it was probably what used to be called the "Pant Well," whence was drawn
      water (supplied from the <span class="pagenum">265</span><a name="link265"
      id="link265"></a>Haining Loch) of a body and bouquet indescribable.
      "Hoots!" scornfully cried, in later days, an old woman, apropos of a new
      and irreproachable supply which had been got for the town from another
      source, "Hoots! It has naether taste nor smell!" Alas! that one should
      record the fact,&mdash;in old days the drainage of the upper town (what
      there was of drainage in those times, that is to say), fell into the
      Haining Loch not a hundred yards from the spot where the town's supply was
      drawn off! And yet people lived in Selkirk to unusually great ages. Our
      ancestors were hardy persons; but perhaps it was only the very fit who
      then survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been a dull, uneventful, depressing life, that of the
      prisoners in Selkirk, more especially in those months between October and
      March, when darkness comes early and the days are chill and grey. What
      news they got was chiefly of fresh disasters to their country's arms in
      Spain, and the rejoicing of the townsfolk over Wellington's victories was
      of necessity exceedingly bitter to the Frenchmen. It was execrable taste
      on the part of the inhabitants of Selkirk thus to show their joy, says the
      writer of the Reminiscences&mdash;"indelicate," he calls it. But the
      chances are that they were chiefly mannerless schoolboys who thus
      misbehaved. I fear he looked for more than poor fallen human nature is
      prepared to give, if he expected the townspeople entirely to suppress
      their pleasure. Many a heart in Selkirk was then following with dire
      anxiety the movements of our Army in the Peninsula, dreading the news that
      any hour might bring of mishap or death to son, brother, or friend; every
      soul the place took the profoundest interest in the welfare of those men
      who had gone from their little community "to fecht the French" and,
      however desirable it might be that the feelings of prisoners should not be
      lacerated, it seems too much to expect that the townsfolk should go apart
      in secret places in order to express, without offence, the joy they must
      feel when those they loved were covering themselves with glory. <span
      class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266" id="link266"></a>Provided that
      no one was ill-mannered enough to jeer at or to taunt the prisoners, I
      hardly think they had a right to complain, more especially as they
      themselves had already sinned in respect of rejoicing openly over victory.
      On a certain occasion they heard of a great French success in Russia. Two
      prisoners concealed themselves and were locked up in the church one Sunday
      after evening service; about midnight these men admitted their comrades,
      and together they roused sleeping Selkirk by a terrific joy-peal of bells.
      Honours were easy between the two nations, I think. Both acted under
      strong feeling; those were strenuous days, and feeling naturally ran high.

      In the writer's possession are letters sent from Spain to Selkirk at this
      period by his grand-uncle, an ensign in the Scots Brigade, now the 94th
      Regiment. One, which gives a vivid picture of the storming and capture of
      Ciudad Rodrigo on 19th January, 1812, could not have failed to arouse
      intense enthusiasm in the town. In so small and friendly a community, no
      doubt everybody was in possession of the chief details of this letter,
      (and of any other that might chance to come from a soldier at the front,)
      within a few hours of its receipt, and that a townsman's regiment should
      be the first to enter the besieged town would be legitimate ground for
      extreme pride. The following is an extract from the letter: "About 5 in
      the afternoon orders came that we were to make the attack at 7 in the
      Evening, the Light Division at one Breach and ours at another. Picks and
      axes were given to the front rank of the Grenadiers, and to the first
      Company of our Regt., and also Ropes to swing us down into the Ditch,
      which we were to clear of any obstructions that were supposed would be
      laid in our way. Accordingly we moved off about dusk, and got under cover
      of a Convent, to a short distance from the Ditch; there we remained till
      the hour of attack; it being come, and everything ready, we rushed forward
      as fast as our legs could carry us, cheering all the way. On reaching
      <span class="pagenum">267</span><a name="link267" id="link267"></a>the
      Ditch, we found it only about six feet high, so we leaped down as quick as
      possible and made to the Breach with all possible speed, and met with no
      obstacles. After getting to it, we found ourselves to be the first there;
      on the front rank getting to the top of it, the Enemy saluted us with a
      volley of grape shot and shells (the latter they had laid across the top
      in rows) the explosion of which was so dreadful that I thought we should
      have been all blown up in the air together.... Some of the Men that had
      got up to the top came tumbling down, dead as herrings. It stunned us for
      a moment, but we gave another cheer and rushed on, scrambled to the top
      and drove the fellows from the Guns opposite the Breach. Our Regt. was
      about five minutes in the Town (and it is only 200 Men strong) before any
      other Regt. came to its support; at last the 5th came, and the others
      followed. The French dogs kept peppering at us with Musketry and
      Hand-grenades at such a rate that I well thought we would all have been
      slain together. At last we drove them from the Ramparts into the Town, and
      then they threw down their Arms and surrendered. I went down from the
      Ramparts into the Town, but such a scene of confusion I never beheld:
      there were our troops plundering the houses as fast as they were able, one
      fellow to be seen with two or three Loaves stuck on his Bayonet, another
      with as much Pork, and in another place a parcel of fellows knocking out
      the end of a Wine Cask with their Firelocks and drinking away with the
      greatest fury; some ravishing the Women, others breaking open doors, and
      into all such a noise, altogether inconceivable. This continued four or
      five hours, and our Brigade was shortly after moved out of the Town, at
      which I was very glad.... We had two Captains killed, but immediately on
      their falling a Sentry was placed over them, to guard them from being
      strip't, and had them afterwards brought to the Camp and decently
      buried.... The Enemy that night blew up the Mines, which killed a great
      many, both of their <span class="pagenum">268</span><a name="link268"
      id="link268"></a>own Men and ours. It was a shocking spectacle, the sight
      of the dead bodies lying at the place where it happened, all bruised and
      burnt quite black, some wanting both Legs, others blown all to pieces,
      Legs and Arms mixed together in confusion; it was there where Genl.
      M'Kinnon was killed. You were always wishing to hear of our Regt. doing
      something great; Now I think it has done a great deal, but I fear much it
      will not receive the praise due to it, as it was not intended that it
      should be the first that should enter the Breach, it was only meant that
      it should clear the way for the other Brigade; but somehow or other we got
      to it before them, and of course did not wait their coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Except on this occasion of the bell-ringing, and one other, when the
      French officers with some difficulty had induced certain of the townsfolk
      to drink to the health of the Emperor, and to shout "<i>Vive l'Empereur</i>"
      friendly relations were unbroken. But the latter unpleasantness at one
      time had threatened to ripen into a very ugly affair. Bloodshed was
      narrowly averted. Friendship, however, was restored, and the prisoners
      continued to make the best of their situation. They obtained a billiard
      table from Edinburgh; they started a café, they opened a theatre, with an
      excellent orchestra of twenty-five performers "superior to all those to
      which the echoes of our Scottish residence had ever till then resounded."
      This theatre was established in a barn which then belonged to the writer's
      grandfather. Frescoes on the walls, which had been painted by the
      prisoners, were still fairly fresh in colour though hopelessly obscure as
      to design, when the writer saw them in his early boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with the time when Peace was proclaimed and the prisoners
      were being sent back to France, it is pleasant to have to record an
      incident greatly to the credit of Selkirk. The pockets of the Frenchmen
      were naturally, in their situation, not very well filled; indeed, amongst
      the hundred and ninety they could raise no more than £60, a sum not nearly
      <span class="pagenum">269</span><a name="link269" id="link269"></a>sufficient
      to provide transport to the sea port of Berwick for the entire party. They
      resolved, therefore, to march on foot, using what money they had to hire
      carriages for the few among them who were in bad health. After an excited
      night (spent by most of the ex-prisoners in the Market-place, where they
      shouted and sang till daylight, like a pack of schoolboys), just as they
      were preparing to set out on their long tramp to Berwick, "an altogether
      unexpected and pleasant sight met our view," writes M. Doisy. "Vehicles of
      all kinds came pouring in by the streets converging on the centre of the
      town, carriages, gigs, tilburys, carts, and a few saddle-horses, all of
      which had been sent by the inhabitants of the surrounding parts to convey
      us free of expense as far as Kelso, about half-way to Berwick. This
      delicate attention had been so well calculated, and so neatly
      accomplished, that we could not do otherwise than avail ourselves of it
      with many thanks. We therefore separated from our Selkirk friends without
      carrying away on the one part or the other any particle of grudge that
      might previously have existed between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar good feeling, however, appears to have been very general between
      the French prisoners and the people of the many Border towns where the
      former were quartered&mdash;though it was almost too much to expect that
      no unpleasantnesses should ever occur, when we remember how great a bogie
      the Emperor Napoleon then was to the majority of British people, and how
      to hate the French was looked on as almost a virtue. "Bless us, and save
      us, <i>and keep the French from us</i>," was a common form of invocation,
      then and later. Persons more ignorant or prejudiced than their neighbours
      were sure, sooner or later, to overstep the mark, and bring disgrace on
      their nation by boorish or brutal conduct to the defenceless prisoners.
      Thus, at Jedburgh for instance, not only did schoolboys sometimes jeer at
      and stone the Frenchmen, but one bitter old man, who no doubt thought that
      in hating the French he was only carrying out a manifest duty, actually
      <span class="pagenum">270</span><a name="link270" id="link270"></a>pointed
      his gun at, and threatened to shoot, a prisoner whom he found outside the
      mile limit. A very regrettable incident occurred, too, in the same town
      during rejoicings over a great British victory. An effigy of the Emperor,
      mounted on a donkey, was paraded by torchlight through the streets and was
      then publicly burned, in full view of the deeply-pained French officers.
      Whatever the faults of the Emperor, he was at least adored by his army,
      and such instances of brutal ill manners were bound to lead to bad blood
      and to reprisals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst themselves, the prisoners do not seem to have been quarrelsome,
      nor were duels common&mdash;for which fact, of course, the lack of
      suitable weapons may probably have been responsible. There was, however, a
      duel at Lauder between two of the prisoners quartered in that town, and
      one cannot help thinking that it must have suggested to Stevenson the duel
      in "St. Ives," between prisoners in Edinburgh Castle. In Stevenson's
      novel, they fought with the separated blades of scissors, securely lashed
      to sticks. At Lauder, they used the blades of razors secured in similar
      fashion. But, whereas in "St. Ives" the result was the death of one
      combatant, in the real duel at Lauder no greater harm came of it than
      slashed faces. It might be bloody enough, a duel with razor-blades, but it
      could not be very dangerous, except to the tips of noses.

    <p>
      It might perhaps be unseemly to quit the subject of Selkirk without making
      at least some mention of a custom which has prevailed there for something
      like four centuries. The great day of the whole year in Selkirk is that of
      the Common Riding, the Riding of the Marches of the town's property. The
      custom as yet gives no sign of waning in popularity; indeed, as the years
      pass, it seems to rise steadily in favour, and where one rode fifty years
      ago there must now be a good half dozen who follow the cavalcade. It is a
      cheerful ride and a beautiful, in the sweet air of a sunny June morning.
      Selkirk needs no awakening that day by the shrill fifes that are so early
      afoot in the streets; even the old and the scant of breath <span
      class="pagenum">271</span><a name="link271" id="link271"></a>rise from
      their beds betimes, and make a push to see the muster of riders in the
      Market Place. Then it is through the shallows of the gushing river, and
      away over the breezy hills, for horsemen all filled with enthusiasm if not
      in all cases very secure of seat. It is a pleasant ride,&mdash;away over
      the hill by "Tibbie Tamson," the lonely grave of a poor eighteenth century
      Suicide, a Selkirk woman, the victim of religious despair. Of unpardoned
      sinners the chief, as she imagined, in a pious frenzy she took her own
      life; therefore must her body be denied Christian burial and the poor
      privilege of lying beside her friends in "the auld Kirk yaird." Bundled
      into a pauper's coffin, she was carted out of Selkirk under a hail of
      stones and of execrations from her righteous neighbours, and here, on the
      quiet hill, her body found rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the route runs across the heather&mdash;where whaups wail eerily and
      the grouse dash out with sudden whir that sets some horses capering&mdash;and
      away to the cairn of the Three Brethren, overlooking Tweed and Fairnilee;
      then down by the Nettley Burn and across Ettrick where Queen Mary is said
      to have forded it, and so home by the Shawburn. to see the Colours "cast"
      in the Market Place. And then to breakfast with an appetite that in
      ordinary circumstances comes only "when all the world is young." It is two
      hundred years and more since it was ordained that the Marches be ridden on
      the first Tuesday of June in each year&mdash;formerly, August had been the
      month&mdash;and that the Deacons of all the Crafts in Selkirk were not
      only to attend themselves, with their horses, but that they were to see
      that every man of their trade who had a horse should also ride, "all in
      their best equipage and furniture." Why the change was made from August to
      June, I do not know,&mdash;unless it was to permit of the introduction of
      those immense and very famous gooseberry-tarts which are so conspicuous a
      feature in Common Riding rejoicings. The day's arrangements then and
      earlier, were much as they are now, no doubt. But there are <span
      class="pagenum">272</span><a name="link272" id="link272"></a>no Kers now
      to slay the Provost, as in the sixteenth century days of Provost Muthag.
      The only danger in these times is that some of the horsemen&mdash;unseasoned
      vessels&mdash;may be induced to swallow one or more of the glasses of raw
      whisky which are passed round with liberal hand as the cavalcade sets out
      from Selkirk. Whether this is a practice ordained of old with the laudable
      object of counteracting any possible risk of chill from the nipping air of
      the early morning, or whether it is done in order to inspire courage in
      the possible John Gilpins of the assemblage, I know not. Yet of those who
      partake, the major part seem to thrive well enough on it; they are none
      the worse in the afternoon, when the great body of the townsfolk stream
      out southward over the hill to the Gala Rig. Here horse races are run,
      over a course most gloriously situated, where a matchless view lies
      widespread to the Cheviots and down to far Liddesdale, and away up among
      the dim blue hills of Ettrick and Yarrow. There were races held here at
      least as early as 1720, and I suppose races of a sort have probably taken
      place annually on the same ground ever since.

      go&mdash;as they say in Selkirk&mdash;"up the Watters," a phrase which, to
      us of "the Forest," used of old to convey the idea of going on a vast
      journey. "Did ye see the Eclipse, on Monday?" asked a Selkirk man of his
      crony. "Man, <i>No!</i> I was up the Watters that day." Which
      reply-conveyed, perhaps not so much the feeling that an eclipse was a
      frivolous affair pertaining to geographically remote Selkirk alone, as
      that the answerer had been too deeply engaged up the waters with other
      business to have leisure to attend to such petty trifles as solar
      phenomena. Business "up the Watters," one used to understand, was not
      seldom protracted far into the night, and at times there were lunar
      phenomena observable, such as double moons, and stars whose place in the
      heavens was not definitely fixed.

      Leaving Selkirk by the Ettrick road, in about a couple of miles we come
      abreast of the spot where Yarrow drowns herself in Ettrick. And here below
      Bowhill, on the sunny, wooded peninsula formed by the two rivers, lies
      Carterhaugh, scene of that famous fairy tale "The Young Tamlane." Tamlane

      A mile or two up the river from Carterhaugh, on Ettrick's right bank,
      stands the interesting and well-preserved old tower of Oakwood, the
      property of the Scotts of Harden, in whose possession it has been since
      1517. Locally, the belief is implicitly held that this tower was, in the
      thirteenth century, the residence of the great Michael Scott, the Wizard,
      out of whose tomb in Melrose Abbey William of Deloraine took

      There <i>was</i> a Michael Scott who once owned Oakwood, but that was long

      name="link277" id="link277"></a>likely that the veritable Michael (Thomas

      Certainly he never lived in the tower that stands now on the steep bank
      hard by the river. That is no thirteenth century building. I fear,
      therefore, that the story of Michael and the Witch of Fauldshope, and of
      how, bursting one day from her cottage in the guise of a hare, he was
      coursed by his own dogs on Fauldshope Hill, can no more be connected with
      Selkirkshire than can the legend of his embassy to Paris, to which city he
      journeyed in a single night, mounted on a great coal-black <span
      class="pagenum">278</span><a name="link278" id="link278"></a>steed, who
      indeed was none other than the Foul Fiend himself. There is, however, a
      Witchie Knowe on Fauldshope; perhaps the Michael who really did live at
      Oakwood, sometime about the beginning of the seventeenth century, may have
      had dealings with the woman, which in some way gave rise to the legend.
      This "witch," by the way, was an ancestress of Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oakwood Tower is not very old, and it never was very strong&mdash;as the
      strength of peel towers is reckoned; its walls are little more than four
      feet in thickness, which is almost flimsy compared with those of its near
      neighbour, Newark. Above the dungeons, Oakwood is three stories in height,
      and its external measurements are thirty-eight by twenty-three and a half
      feet. Into one wall is built a stone on which are the initals R.S. L.M,
      initials of Robert Scott and his wife, probably a Murray. Between them is
      the Harden crescent; and below, the date, and 1602, which is no doubt the
      true year of the present tower's erection. Tradition tells of a haunted
      chamber in Oakwood; the "Jingler's Room," it was called, but what the
      story was, the writer has not been able to learn. The tower now is used
      chiefly as a farm building, and if there are any hauntings they probably
      take the unpleasant form of rats.

    <p>
      Following up the Ettrick, presently we come to the village of
      Ettrickbridgend, near to which are the picturesque Kukhope Linns and
      Kirkhope Tower, a well preserved Border peel. In this tower in old days at
      times dwelt Auld Wat of Harden, or one of his family. Tradition tells that
      it was Wat who first spanned Ettrick with a bridge. It was a penance,
      self-inflicted, because of a mishap that occurred at the ford here to a
      young boy, heir of the Nevilles, whom Wat had carried off from his home in
      Northumberland. Wat's bridge stood a little way above the site of that
      which now crosses Ettrick at Ettrickbridgend, and I am told&mdash;though I
      have not seen it&mdash;that a stone from the old bridge, with the Harden
      coat of arms carved on it, may now be seen built into the present
      structure.

      These Border hills have produced from time to time many a long-distance
      runner of immense local celebrity,&mdash;such for instance, as the
      far-famed Will of Phaup&mdash;but few of them, I imagine, could have
      "lived" with Jamie Telfer in that burst of his across the trackless
      heather and the boggy moors from the Dodhead, over by the headwaters of
      Ale, across Borthwick, across Teviot, on to Slitrig at "Stobs Ha'," and
      from there back again to Teviot at Coultercleuch. It must be a good
      sixteen miles at the least, across a country over which no runner could
      travel at a pace so fast as that with which the ballad credits Jamie. But
      if anyone did this run, I fear it was no Jamie Telfer. At least in the
      fair Dodhead up Ettrick there was at the supposed date of the ballad, and
      for generations before, no Telfer, but a Scott. The Dodhead of the ballad
      must be some other place of the same name, possibly that near Penchrise,
      by Skelfhill.

    <p>
      One, in accord with the local pronunciation of the word&mdash;"Delorran,"
      with the accent on the second syllable&mdash;gives its origin as from the
      Gaelic, "dal Grain," the place or land of Orain, who, I understand, was a
      Celtic saint. There is also the explanation given by the Rev. Dr. Russell
      of Yarrow, in the Statistical Account of the Parish of 1833. "In 1503,
      James IV endowed his Queen, the Lady Margaret of England, with the Forest
      of Ettrick and Tower of Newark, which had formerly been the dowry of Mary
      of Guelders. Hence, probably, our two farms of Deloraine (de la reine)
      received their name, or afterwards perhaps from Mary of <i>Lorraine</i>."
      One would prefer to adopt Dr. Russell's interpretation of the name, but
      probably the place was called "Delorran" long before the day of any of the
      historical characters mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher still up Ettrick is Tushielaw, with its fragment of<span
      class="pagenum">282</span><a name="link282" id="link282"></a> a ruined
      tower, the home in old days of that formidable freebooter Adam Scott, "the
      king of the Border," or "king of thieves." Local tradition tells that he
      was hanged by James V to the branch of an ash tree that grew within his
      own castle walls&mdash;retributive justice on a man who had himself, in
      like manner, sent to their doom so many poor wretches from the branches of
      that same tree. The ash no longer stands, but in <i>Chambers' Gazetteer</i>
      for 1832 there is this note concerning it: "It is curious to observe that
      along its principal branches there are yet visible a number of nicks, or
      hollows, over which the ropes had been drawn wherewith he performed his
      numerous executions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Like too many local traditions, however, the story of his execution will
      not bear examination. Adam Scott was arrested and hanged in Edinburgh, a
      full month before the King set out on his memorable expedition to pacify
      the Border. James certainly laid a heavy hand on the freebooters; and he
      appears also to have very materially altered the face of things in other
      ways in these Border hills. The timber which clothed them began from this
      time to disappear&mdash;birch and oak it appears to have been for the most
      part, interspersed with ash, mountain-ash, thorn, and hazel, to judge by
      the numbers of stumps and pieces of decayed trees still found in mossy
      ground. They mostly suggest timber of no great size, but now and again the
      remains of a fine tree are come upon, even in exposed and high-lying
      situations. The remains of a very large oak, for instance, were discovered
      some years ago during draining operations among the wild hills right at
      the head of Jed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably James destroyed a great deal of timber in his efforts to convert
      the country into a sheep-run. According to Pitscottie, the king soon had
      "ten thousand sheep going in the forest, under the keeping of Andrew Bell,
      who made the King as good an account of them as if they had gone in the
      bounds of Fife." <span class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283"
      id="link283"></a>James V no doubt was a good husbandman,&mdash;it was his
      boast that in these wilds he "made the rush bush keep the cow,"&mdash;but
      he was a better husbandman than he was a sportsman, at least as we now
      understand the word.

      We should now probably call him a pot-hunter. It was early in June when he
      started on his expedition; young calves are then with the hinds, and the
      harts are yet low in condition, and "in the velvet" as to their horns. Yet
      Pitscottie says: "I heard say he slew in these bounds eighteen score of
      harts." However, if his expedition had to be made then, <span
      class="pagenum">284</span><a name="link284" id="link284"></a>his army&mdash;and
      it was an army&mdash;must necessarily be fed; and no doubt if he wanted to
      run sheep there, the stock of deer had to be cleared out.

      But what a place for game of all kinds this forest must then have been.
      One may learn from the place-names which still linger among the hills what
      manner of beasts formerly inhabited this part of the Border: Ox-cleuch,
      Deer-law, Hart-leap, Hynd-hope, Fawn-burn, Wolf-cleuch, Brock-hill,
      Swine-brae, Boar-cleuch, Cat-slack. The Hart's-leap is said to have got
      its name owing to an incident that occurred during King James's expedition
      in 1530; a deer, in sight of the king, is said to have cleared at one
      bound a distance so remarkable that James directed his followers to leave
      a memorial of the leap. Two grey whinstones here, twenty-eight feet apart,
      are said to be those which were then set up. Ox-cleuch was probably so
      named from some ancient adventure with a Urus, or wild bull, or possibly
      because it was a favourite haunt of those formidable beasts. Their skulls
      are still occasionally dug up during the process of draining swampy lands
      among our Border hills. There is a very fine specimen <span class="pagenum">285</span><a
      name="link285" id="link285"></a>now at Synton (between Selkirk and
      Hawick), home of one of the oldest branches of the Scott family.

      If one may judge from that skull, the horns must have been something like
      twice the size of the ox of the present day. He was the ancestor, I

      Up this burn's right bank, through the lonely vale and over the hills runs
      a road leading to Hawick, and on your right, as you head in that
      direction, a few miles up is Buccleuch, one of the earliest possessions in
      the Border of the great Scott clan. Near the road, in a deep ravine or
      cleuch, is pointed out the spot where, they say, the buck was slain from
      which' originated the title of the present ducal house. Farther on, just
      upon the water-shed between Ettrick and Teviot, is Bellenden, which became
      the Scotts' mustering place and whose name was the clan's slogan. As Mr.
      Thomson's sketches show, it is a wild country enough; in winter its
      bleakness at times is surely past the power of words to tell. It must be a
      hardy race that can live and thrive here. A land of swamp, and sullen,
      dark, moss-hag, this must have been in days of old. Still among the hills,
      bogs and lochs innumerable are scattered: of the latter, Clearburn,
      Ringside, Crooked Loch, Windylaw, Hellmuir, Alemuir, and various <span
      class="pagenum">287</span><a name="link287" id="link287"></a>others, all
      within a few miles, but not many, I think, such as need tempt the
      wandering fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of miles up Ettrick, above Tushielaw, is Thirlestane, the seat of
      Lord Napier of Ettrick, surrounded by its woods. It is a mansion built
      something less than a hundred years ago, but close to it are the remains
      of the old Thirlestane Castle. I do not know if Hertford's long arm was
      responsible in 1544 for its ruin. It is probable enough. The stronghold
      belonged then to Sir John Scott, a prominent man in those days, and the
      only Scottish baron at Fala-muir who did not refuse to follow James V into
      England, for which reason the king charged "our lion herauld and his
      deputies for the time be and, to give and to graunt to the said John
      Scott, ane Border of ffleure de lises about his coatte of armes, sik as is
      on our royal banner, and alsua ane bundell of launces above his helmet,
      with thir words, <i>Readdy, ay Readdy</i>, that he and all his
      after-cummers may bruik the samine as a pledge and taiken of our guid will
      and kyndnes for his true worthines." Lord Napier is this John Scott's
      descendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the river from Thirlestane are the ruins of another castle&mdash;Gamescleuch,
      built by Simon Scott, named Long Spear, a son of John of Thirlestane.
      Tradition says that Gamescleuch was never occupied, but was allowed to
      fall into decay because its owner, Simon of the Spear, was poisoned by his
      step-mother the night before he should have been married and have taken up
      his abode there.

      We are getting far into the wild hills now, near to the head of Ettrick,
      by Ettrick Pen, Wind Fell, and Capel Fell, all hills considerably over two
      thousand feet in height. But before crossing over to Yarrow and St.
      Mary's, there remain to be noticed Ettrick Kirk, and James Hogg's
      birthplace, Ettrick Hall. Ettrick Kirk, of course, is inalienably
      associated with the Rev. Thomas Boston, "Boston of Ettrick," minister of
      the parish for a quarter of a century, a man who left a deep mark on the
      religious life of Scotland. He died here in 1732, and <span class="pagenum">288</span><a
      name="link288" id="link288"></a>his monument stands in the little
      graveyard by the kirk, not lar from the head-stone to the memory of the
      Ettrick Shepherd, and near to the spot where, as the stone tells us,
      "lyeth William Laidlaw, the far-famed Will of Phaup, who for feats of
      Frolic, Agility, and Strength, had no equal in his day." Liaidlaw was
      Hogg's grandfather.

      How many persons now-a-days are familiar with, or indeed, perhaps, ever
      heard of, Boston's "Fourfold State," or his "Crook in the Lot"? Perhaps in
      Ettrick there may yet be, in cottages, an odd copy or two, belonging to,
      and possibly yet read by, very old people. But Boston, who as a theologian
      had once so marked an influence, is now little more than a name, even to
      the descendants of his flock in Ettrick, and his books, which <span
      class="pagenum">289</span><a name="link289" id="link289"></a>formerly were
      to be found in almost every peasant's house in Scotland, are unknown to
      later generations. Nor, perhaps, is that great matter for wonder. It must
      be confessed that these writings, which, up to even quite a recent date,
      had so great a hold on the Scottish peasant, and which, indeed, with the
      Bible formed almost his only reading, do not appeal to present day
      readers. The plums in the pudding to modern eyes seem few and far between.
      But there <i>are</i> plums to be found, and many a forcible expression. In
      "The Crook in the Lot," for instance, where his theme is profligacy, the
      expression is a happy one whereby he warns the vicious man against the
      possibility of a "leap out of Delilah's lap into Abraham's bosom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most of his class and creed in those days, Boston was stern and
      unbending in his Calvinism, and when he came to Ettrick in 1707, he was
      faced by a state of affairs that bred for a time great friction between
      minister and congregation. The flock had been for a while without a
      shepherd, and laxity had crept into their church-going. Boston had to
      complain of the "indecent carriage of the people at the kirk, going out
      and in, and up and down the kirkyard the time of divine service." But he
      speedily drilled them into a line of conduct more seemly; and whereas when
      he dispensed the Sacrament for the first time in 1710 there had been
      present only fifty-seven communicants, in 1731 when he dispensed it for
      the last time, there were no fewer than seven hundred and seventy-seven.
      Crowds of people from other parishes came vast distances over the pathless
      mountains in order to be present. Where did they all find food and
      accommodation, one wonders. The farmers, then as now the most hospitable
      and kindly of human beings, fed and housed numbers, as a matter of course,
      but they could not accommodate all, and there was then no inn at
      Tushielaw, none indeed nearer than Selkirk. Great must have been the
      fervour of those many scores of men and women who resolutely tramped so
      far over <span class="pagenum">290</span><a name="link290" id="link290"></a>the
      wild hills to be present at "the Sacrament." There were no roads in those
      days, or practically none.

      Even at late as 1792, the Statistical Account of the Parish says: "The
      roads are almost impassable. The only road that looks like a turnpike is
      to Selkirk, but even it in many places is so deep as greatly to obstruct
      travelling. The distance is about sixteen miles, and it requires four
      hours to ride it. The snow also at times is a great inconvenience; often
      for many months we can have no intercourse with our neighbours.... Another
      great disadvantage is the want of bridges. For many hours the traveller is
      obstructed on his journey when the waters are swelled." Such was the
      condition of the hill country sixty-years after Boston's death. In his day
      it must have been even worse; probably the only road that resembled a road
      in 1792 was a mere track earlier in the century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by Ettrick Kirk is Ettrick Hall, where Hogg was born. Though in name
      suggestive of a lordly mansion, it was in reality but a mean, and rather
      damp, little cottage, or "butt and ben," of which there are now no
      remains. I understand that the walls fell down about the year 1830. There
      is <span class="pagenum">291</span><a name="link291" id="link291"></a>now
      a monument to "the Shepherd" where the cottage stood; and there is of
      course the commemorative statue over by St. Mary's, hard by "Tibbie
      Shiels."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogg was, as the late Professor Ferrier said: "after Hums (<i>proximus sed

      part you take the vale of Ettrick, there is about it, and about its
      scenery and its associations, a charm, different perhaps from that of the
      more widely famed Yarrow, yet almost equally powerful. There is in the
      summer season a solemnity and a peace brooding over these "round-backed,
      kindly hills," that act like a charm on the body and mind that are weary.
      Each vale has its distinctive peculiarities, yet each blends imperceptibly

    <p>
      From the head of Ettrick by Ettrick Kirk over to Yarrow is but little more
      than a step across the hills, either by the bridle track by Scabcleuch and
      Penistone Knowe over to the Riskinhope Burn and the head of the Loch of
      the Lowes, for those afoot; or by the road up Tushielaw Burn, for those on
      whom time, or years, press unduly, and who prefer to drive. It is not a
      very good road, but it serves, though the descent to St. Mary's is
      something of the abruptest,&mdash;one in ten, I think. If the bridle track
      has been followed, as one comes down towards Riskinhope, there, on the
      opposite side of the valley, is Chapelhope, for ever associated with
      Hogg's "Brownie of Bodesbeck." And at Riskinhope itself, Renwick, last of
      the Scottish Covenanting Martyrs, preached no long time before his
      execution at the Grassmarket in Edinburgh in February, 1688. "When he
      prayed that day, few<span class="pagenum">293</span><a name="link293"

      curses on the bird as it wheels and plunges overhead, wailing dolefully.

      But of Yarrow, how is one to write? The task is hopeless, whether it be to
      speak of its beauty, of its legend, its poetry, or of its associations.
      From Scott and Wordsworth downwards, what poet has not sung its praises?
      However halting may be his pen, what writer in prose has not tried in
      words to picture its scenes? It is left to one now only to repeat what has
      been said by better men; at the best, one may but paraphrase the words of
      another. There is nothing new to be said of Yarrow, no fresh beauty to be
      pointed out. Its charm affects each one differently; each must see and
      feel for himself. But whether the season be sweetest summer-tide, or that
      when winter's blast comes black and roaring down the glens, fiercely
      driving before it sheets of water snatched from the tortured bosom of lone
      Saint Mary's,&mdash;there, still, abides the indescribable charm of
      Yarrow. Yet on the whole, I think almost that I should prefer my visit to
      be in the winter time, if a few fine days might be assured, or days at
      least without storm. In the summer season now, and especially since the
      advent of the motor car, from morning till night so constant a stream of
      visitors and <span class="pagenum">295</span><a name="link295" id="link295"></a>tourists
      passes through the vale, and along the lake side, that even Yarrow's
      deathless charm is broken, her peace disturbed; one's soul can take no
      rest there now, far from the clamour of the outer world.

      This is the kirk where the lovers lie buried, almost within distant sight
      of the ancient tower from which they had fled, and whose ruins are still
      to be seen near Blackhouse, on the Douglas Burn. The Douglas stones,
      which, tradition tells us, mark the spot where Lady Margaret's seven
      brothers fell under the sword of her lover, are out high on the moor: but
      there are eleven, not seven, stones, though only three are left standing.
      It was at Blackhouse, one may remember, that Sir Walter first made the
      acquaintance of Willie Laidlaw, whose father was tenant of the farm. James
      Hogg was shepherd here from 1790 to 1800, but he had left before Sir
      Walter's visit, though the two met very shortly after. It was whilst Hogg
      was in service here that there came the tremendous snow storm of 1794, of
      which he gave so vivid a description in Blackwood's Magazine of July,
      1819.

      destroyed about the year 1557, and was never rebuilt. A Cranstoun, flying
      from the Scotts, sought sanctuary in the holy building, and the Scotts,
      heedless of the terrors of excommunication, burnt it down. "They burned
      the Chapel for very rage," says The Lay, because Cranstoun escaped them.
      The churchyard is little used now, but a few privileged families do still,
      I understand, bury their dead in that quiet spot. It is an enviable place

      Across the loch from the quiet grave-yard on the hill, lies "Bowerhope's
      lonely top," and Bowerhope farm, so loved of its tenant of many years ago.
      In his "Reminiscences of Yarrow," the late Rev. Dr. Russell mentions that
      "Bowerhope farmhouse was so low in the roof that my father at the
      exhortations had to stand between two of the rafters, so that the Kitchen
      full of people and full of smoke was not the most pleasant place to speak
      in. Yet old Sandy Cunningham, the tenant, used to say: 'Ministers may talk
      o' Heevin' as they like; commend me to Bowerhope; I cud tak a tack [lease]
      o't to a' eternity.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      On our right, on the same side of the loch with us as we stand facing
      Bowerhope, is Henderland, where, on a spot called the Chapel Knowe, is a
      grave-slab, and on it, sculptured, a sword and what appear to be armorial
      bearings, with the inscription: <span class="pagenum">299</span><a
      name="link299" id="link299"></a>"Here lyis Perys of Cokburne and hys wyfe
      Marjory." This, we used to be told, was the grave of a famous freebooter,
      whom King James V, (dropping in, as it were, one day while the
      unsuspecting reiver sat at dinner,) took, and hanged over the gate of his
      own castle, the tower whose weather-battered fragments are still to be
      seen here.

      His wife, it was said, fled to the adjacent Dow Glen, a rocky chasm
      through which rushes the Henderland burn, and there, says Sir Walter
      Scott, cowering on what is still called the Lady's Seat, she strove "to
      drown amid the roar of a foaming cataract, the tumultuous noise which
      announced the close of his existence." But Cokburne of Henderland, like
      Adam Scott of Tushiealaw, was executed in Edinburgh, before King James set
      out on his expedition. Moreover, that Cokburn of Henderland's Christian
      name was <span class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300" id="link300"></a>William.
      This, therefore, cannot be the grave of James' victim in 1530. but
      whatever the real story of "Perys Cokburne and hys wyfe, Marjory," their
      fate has given rise to a ballad fuller of pathos than all the countless

      Just by Henderland is Coppercleuch, (called Cappercleuch in my boyhood,)
      and below it, Megget, flowing into the loch&mdash;a troutful stream, at
      least in earlier days. Pike used to bask in <span class="pagenum">301</span><a

      Up Megget's left bank runs a hill road leading over into Tweedsmuir. It
      has been negotiated by motors, but it is far from being a desirable road
      for that form of traffic, or indeed for any except foot traffic. The

      Robert Chambers described it in 1827 as "a small, neat house, kept by a
      decent shepherd's widow... It is scarcely possible to conceive anything
      more truly delightful than a week's ruralizing in this comfortable little
      mansion, with the means of so much amusement at the very door, and so many
      interesting objects of sight and sentiment lying closely around."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps in some ways it is as delightful now as ever; but motors and
      bicycles have changed its air, and its aspect. They seem as inconsistent
      with the air of "Tibbie's" as would be a railway train, or penny steamers
      on the loch. Necessarily, there is now about the place a more commercial
      air; it is no longer the mere cottage, with its simple fare of oatmeal
      porridge,&mdash;cooked as nowhere now it is cooked; milk, rich and frothy;
      of ham and eggs, the mere whiff of which would bring you in ravenous from
      loch or hill; of fresh caught trout fried in oatmeal and still sizzling as
      they were brought in. There are trout now as of <span class="pagenum">303</span><a
      name="link303" id="link303"></a>old, no doubt, and hens yet lay eggs, and
      pigs are turned to bacon; but you eat now with a sense of having a train
      to catch, or a motor hurriedly to jump into; your eye seems to be ever on
      the clock, and the old air of leisure and of peace is gone. Tibbie Shiel
      herself departed in time. She who, when all the world was young, listened
      many a time to that Shepherd who had
    </p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Found in youth a harp among the hills,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I think could ill have brooked this twentieth century rush and hurry; she
      was spared the trial of finding the pure air of St. Mary's poisoned by the
      stench of petrol fumes. A native of Ettrick, born in 1782, Tibbie lived at
      her home in Yarrow till the summer of 1878, and she lies in the same
      kirk-yaird that "haps" all that is mortal of James Hogg. And here by the
      loch, almost at her door, with plaid around him, the Shepherd sits in
      effigy, as Christopher North predicted to him in 1824, with "honest face
      looking across St. Mary's Loch and up towards the Grey Mare's Tail, while
      by moonlight all your own fairies will weave a dance round its pedestal."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were weird things, those box beds, that have been mentioned as still
      existing in Tibbie Shiel's cottage, weird, and responsible for much
      ill-health, more especially one would suppose, for consumption. They were
      built into the wall of a room, and they had wooden doors that could be
      drawn close at night, entirely cutting them off from the room, and
      jealously excluding every breath of fresh air. Some had a very small
      sliding trap, or eyelet hole, in one of the doors, opening at the side
      just above the pillow, but the custom was, as I understand, to shut even
      that. The box-bed was of old almost universal in peasants' cottages in the
      Border. No doubt it gave a certain amount of privacy to the occupant or

      present writer can remember the case of a young man of twenty-five or so,
      who, to the puzzled wonder of his friends, <span class="pagenum">304</span><a
      name="link304" id="link304"></a>died of a galloping consumption. "I canna
      think hoo he could hae gotten't," said his sister to the daughter of her
      mistress. "He was aye <i>that</i> carefu' o' himsel'. Od! he wad hap
      himself up that warm, an' he aye drew the doors o' his bed close, an'
      shuttit the verra keek-hole. Na! I canna think hoo he could hae catched
      it."

      To add to the sanitary joys of those homes of disease germs, it was, too,
      the almost universal custom to use the space below the bed as a kind of
      store house. The writer can remember as a boy to have seen in one of the
      most decent and respectable of such cottages, bags of potatoes stowed
      under the sleeping place occupied by a husband and wife! <span

      the Loch, and following the road that leads down Yarrow to Selkirk, on our
      left, half a mile or so from the road and overhanging the burn, stands the
      massive little tower of Dryhope. This was the birthplace, about the year
      1550, of the beautiful Mary Scott, the Flower of Yarrow, bride of Scott of
      Harden. I suppose that Harden must have succeeded his father-in-law in the
      possession of Dryhope, for in 1592, James VI issued orders to demolish the
      tower of Dryhope, "pertaining to Walter Scott of Harden who was art and
      part of the late treasonable act perpetuate against His Highness' own
      person at Falkland." James' instructions, however, cannot have been
      carried out very effectually, if at all, for Dryhope, though roofless, is
      in rather better preservation than are the majority of Border peels.

      And now, on the far side of Yarrow, we pass Altrive, the farm which, from
      1814 till his death in 1835, Hogg leased from the Duke of Buccleuch, at a
      merely nominal rent. Here, as Allan Cunningham said, he had "the best
      trout in Yarrow, the finest lambs on its braes, the finest grouse on its
      hills, and as good as a <i>sma' still</i> besides." Indeed he must almost
      have needed a "sma' still," in order effectually to entertain the crowds
      of people who came here unasked, to visit him, once he had established his
      reputation as a Hon. The tax on him must have been even heavier in
      proportion than it was on Sir Walter at Abbotsford.

      Farther down, by the intersection of the cross road that leads over to
      Traquair and Tweed, there is the Gordon Arms, snuggest of fishing
      quarters, where in the endless twilights of June and July you may lie long
      awake, yet half steeped in sleep, listening contentedly to the wavering
      trill of whaups floating eerily over the hill in the still night air; or
      in the lightest dreamland you forecast the basket of tomorrow. It was
      here, at the Gordon Arms, that Scott and Hogg parted for the last time in
      the autumn of 1830, when the waters were already rising high that were so
      soon to close over Sir Walter's head. Slowly they <span class="pagenum">306</span><a
      name="link306" id="link306"></a>walked together a mile down the road,
      Scott leaning heavily on Hogg's shoulder, and "I cannot tell what it was,"
      wrote the latter afterwards, "but there was something in his manner that
      distressed me.

      I had ever heard him do before, and all mixed with sorrow for my worldly

      From 1791 to 1883 there were the Russells, father and son,&mdash;the
      Reverend Dr. Robert Russell and the Reverend Dr. James Russell, whose
      names were household words far beyond the bounds of Yarrow, and at whose
      manse old and young, rich and poor, were equally made welcome. And after
      them came the Reverend Dr. Borland, who died in 1912, and whose "Raids and
      Reivers" is a Border classic. It is a remarkable record, and a wonderful
      testimony to the pure air of Yarrow. During his long life Dr. Robert
      Russell never spent a single day in bed, nor until three days before his
      death was he ever prescribed for by a doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yarrow Kirk was built in 1640, and the first minister of the <span
      class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308" id="link308"></a>Parish after
      the Revolution was the Reverend John Rutherford, maternal
      great-grandfather of Sir Walter Scott. Dr. James Russell gives a quaint
      account of the church as it was in 1826, in the time of his father. "The
      interments," he says, "which had taken place in the course of nearly two
      hundred years, and the wish for proximity to Church walls, had had the
      effect of raising the ground of the graveyard around the church
      considerably above its level. In front, the earth outside was two feet,
      and at the corner of the aisle fully four feet higher. In consequence, the
      lower walls were covered with a green damp, and the rain water flowed into
      the passages. In winter the water froze, and my father used to say that he
      often got a slide to the pulpit." This matter, however, was remedied in
      1826, when many improvements were made in and around the church. One
      improvement which Dr. Russell mentions had to do with the shepherds' dogs,
      which then invariably accompanied their masters to church&mdash;a practice
      which I think died out but recently. "There were no doors on the seats,"
      says Dr. Russell, "and nothing but a narrow deal in each as a footboard,
      and no separation below between them. The planking on the passages was
      very deficient, and a great deal of the earthen floor was thus exposed,
      and it can easily be imagined that when the shepherds from Ettrick, as
      well as from Yarrow, came to church, each shepherd as regularly
      accompanied by his dog as encased in his plaid&mdash;no matter what the
      weather or the season&mdash;what frequent rows there were. On the
      slightest growl they all pricked up their ears. If a couple of them fell
      out and showed fight, it was the signal for a general <i>mêlée</i>. The
      rest that were prowling about, or half asleep at their masters' feet,
      rushed from their lairs, found a way through below the pews, and among the
      feet of the occupants, and raised literally such a <i>dust</i> as fairly
      enveloped them. Then the strife waxed fierce and furious, the noise became
      deafening, the voice of the minister was literally drowned, and he was
      fain to pause, whether in preaching or in <span class="pagenum">309</span><a
      name="link309" id="link309"></a>prayer. Two or three shepherds had to
      leave their places and use their <i>nibbies</i> unmercifully before the
      rout was quelled, and the service of the sanctuary resumed." Such a scene
      as the above was quite an ordinary occurrence in a country church in
      Scotland, early in the nineteenth century&mdash;and in remote districts
      even later than that; minister and congregation were accustomed to it, and
      took it as a matter of course. The shepherd's dogs could not be left
      behind to their own devices; and it was a matter of necessity that their
      master should go to church. There was no more to be said, not even when
      the dogs (as they often did) with long-drawn howls joined in the singing
      of the psalms. And when the benediction was pronounced, (which "to cheat
      the dowgs," was always done with the congregation seated,) then, at the
      first movement after it, a perfect storm of barking broke out as the dogs
      poured out of the building ahead of the people.

      Just below Yarrow Church are the ruins&mdash;I think not much more than
      the foundations&mdash;of Deuchar tower, a Scott stronghold, perhaps, like
      so many others, or maybe a holding of some descendent of the Outlaw
      Murray. And hard by Deuchar Mill is the picturesque old bridge with its
      broken arch stretched, like the stump of a maimed arm, towards the farther
      shore of Yarrow. It is a bridge that dates from about the year 1653. The
      burgh records of Peebles for that year show that the magistrates then
      ordained "that all in the town who have horses shall send the same for a.
      day, to carry lime for the said brig, under a penalty of forty shillings."
      That bridge stood till 1734, when the south arch was wrecked by a great
      flood. To restore the arch was a task at that time beyond the means of the
      district, and for some years those who lived on the south side of Yarrow
      and who wished to attend Yarrow Church, could do so only at the cost of
      wading the water, a feat in flood time impossible, and in the winter
      season a trial to be endured with difficulty even by the most hardy. The
      dead, in many instances, could not be buried beside their friends in the
      <span class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a>old
      churchyard; children born in parts of the parish south of Yarrow could be
      baptised only at uncertain times and after indefinite delay; and marriages
      frequently had to be postponed.

      Finally, of the money required for repair of the bridge, owing to various
      circumstances only the half could be raised, and the arch put in after a
      delay of several years was of such peculiar construction, and so steep and
      causeway-like on the south side that it was not without difficulty that
      even an empty cart could cross. "Besides," says Dr. Russell, "there was
      little earth on the stones that formed the arch to steady and protect it."
      Nevertheless, it held together for the best part of a century, and then,
      suddenly, it collapsed one winter's afternoon, just after the roadman's
      cart had crossed. A new bridge had been erected just opposite the church,
      and no farther attempt was <span class="pagenum">311</span><a
      name="link311" id="link311"></a>made to repair the old one. There it
      stands, a pathetic and picturesque memorial of old days.

      It seems always to me that these old broken bridges&mdash;there are two in
      Yarrow&mdash;strike a note fittingly attuned to the dirge murmured by the
      water as it wanders through the vale, strikingly in keeping with its
      mournful traditions and with the inexplicable sadness that for ever broods
      here. This is the very heart of the Dowie Dens of Yarrow. Here is the

      too, a little above Deucbar Bridge, and beyond the church, it, the famous
      "inscribed stone" of Yarrow, on the merits of which, as on the question of
      its age, I am not qualified to express an opinion. The place where, it
      stands was waste moorland about the beginning of last century, and the
      stone was uncovered when the first attempts were being made to reclaim it.
      In his "Reminiscences of Yarrow," Dr. James Russell says on this subject:
      "On more than twenty different spots of this moor were large cairns, in
      many of which fine yellow dust, and in one of which an old spear-head, was
      found. Two unhewn massive stones still stand, about a hundred yards
      distant from each other, which doubtless are the monuments of the dead.
      The real tradition simply bears that here a deadly feud was settled by
      dint of arms: the upright stones mark the place where the two lords or
      leaders fell, and the bodies of followers were thrown into a marshy pool
      called the Dead Lake, in the adjoining haugh. It is probable that this is
      the locality of "the Dowie Dens of Yarrow." About three hundred yards
      westward, when the cultivation of this moor began, the plough struck upon
      a large flat stone of unhewn greywacke bearing a Latin inscription. Bones
      and ashes lay beneath it, and on every side the surface presented verdant
      patches of grass." The inscription is difficult to decipher, and readings
      differ; all, however, seem to agree as to the termination: "<i>Hic jacent
      in tumulo duo filli Liberalis</i>;" and it is supposed to date from about
      the fifth century.

      make a man great in the rude battle of life, Mungo Park stands without a
      rival." His dauntless spirit stands out conspicuous in the last words he
      ever sent home: "Though the Europeans who were with me were dead, and
      though I myself were half dead, I would still persevere, and if I could
      not succeed in the object of my journey, I would at last die on the
      Niger." That, I think, is the same fearless spirit that has so recently
      touched to the core the inmost heart of the Nation, the spirit displayed
      in the last message home of another dauntless explorer and his comrades,
      who have perished also for duty's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Park was less heard of then&mdash;more than a century back; news
      filtered slowly in those days; he did not at the moment become a national
      hero. And if a man is seldom a prophet in his own country, it is surely
      from members of his own family that he is apt last of all to receive the
      honour which is his due. When Mungo came home in 1797 from his first
      African expedition, his elder brother, then tenant of Foulshiels, ("a
      man," says Lockhart, "remarkable for strength both of mind and body,")
      chanced to be in Selkirk when the explorer arrived there. That night, as
      the worthy farmer lay asleep in bed, he was awakened by his mother, who
      told him to get up; there was "a man chappin' (knocking) at the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ay!" drowsily muttered the disturbed sleeper, weary from a long day
      passed at the market, turning himself over in <span class="pagenum">315</span><a
      name="link315" id="link315"></a>bed, "I daursay that'll be oor Munga. I
      saw him gettin' aff the coach in Selkirk the day."

      It was this Archibald Park who was riding one day with Sir Walter Scott&mdash;"the
      Shirra"&mdash;. when, in a desolate part of the country, they came
      unexpectedly on a desperate gang of gipsies, one of whom was "wanted" for
      murder. Park did not hesitate an instant, but seized the man and dragged
      him away from under the very noses of his lawless, threatening comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite to Foulshiels, on the farther bank of Yarrow, stands "Newark's
      stately tower," the most famous, and I think, from its situation, the most
      beautiful of all the Border strongholds. Situation and surroundings are
      perfect; I know of no scene more captivating, whether you view it from
      Foulshiels, or stand by the castle itself, or, climbing high up on its
      ramparts, gaze around where wood and hill and stream blend in a beauty
      that is matchless. And from far below comes the voice of Yarrow, chafing
      among its rocks and boulders, moaning perhaps as it moaned that cruel day
      after the battle of Philiphaugh, when, on Slain Man's Lea, hard by the
      castle, Lesly's prisoners were butchered in cold blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newark is the best preserved of all the famous Border <span class="pagenum">316</span><a
      name="link316" id="link316"></a>towers. And this we owe to the House of
      Buccleuch. Writing of the ancient towers of Ettrick and Yarrow, the
      Reverend Dr. James Russell says: "Some of them were burned down when clans
      were in conflict with each other; but what was allowable in the period of
      Border warfare was without excuse in our times of peace. Even the grim
      grey ruins were interesting features of the landscape, and worthy of being
      spared. But, worse than 'time's destroying sway,' the ruthless hand of
      vandalism has swept the greater part of them away, as standing in the way
      of some fancied improvement, or to employ the material for building some
      modern dyke or dwelling. Even Newark Castle, the stateliest of them all,
      was thus desecrated through the bad taste of the factor of the day, so
      recently as the beginning of this [the nineteenth] century, and the best
      of the stones from the walls and enclosing fence pulled down for the
      building of a farmhouse immediately in front on the Slain Man's Lea. The
      present noble proprietor [the fifth Duke of Buccleuch, who died in 1884],
      was so displeased and disgusted with the proceedings, that when he came
      into power he swept the modern houses away, and restored stones that in an
      evil hour had been abstracted, and put the ancient pile into a state of
      perfect preservation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Built sometime before 1423&mdash;it is referred to as the "new werke" in a
      charter of that date to Archibald, Earl of Douglas,&mdash;Newark Castle
      was a royal hunting seat; the royal arms are carved on a stone high up on
      its western wall. But in its time it has seen war as well as sport; in
      1548 Lord Grey captured it for Edward VI, and in 1650 it was garrisoned
      for a while by Cromwell's men after Dunbar. It is of peace, however,
      rather than of war that one thinks when wandering here; and one recalls
      how Anne, Duchess of Monmouth and Buccleuch, quilting the throng of men
      and the hideous later turmoil of her life, retired here with her children
      after the execution of her unhappy husband in 1685. To what more beautiful
      and restful scene could she have carried the burden of her sorrows? <span

      is Yair itself; and on the hither side, nestling above a lofty bank among
      its grand old trees, the beautiful ruin of Fairnilee, with its hospitable
      modern mansion hard by. It was in this line old seventeenth-century

      Then, higher up the river a mile or thereby, at the foot of Neidpath Hill,
      the long deep, swift hurrying stream in which, when autumn floods have
      done their work, there is not a yard where a lordly salmon may not be
      hooked. And higher still, there is Caddonfoot, and Clovenfords, in whose
      little inn Sir Walter used to stay before he lived at Ashiesteel; and the
      Nest, snug quarters of a famous Edinburgh Fishing Club, among whose
      members in old days was included the name of many an eminent Scot. Then
      opposite the Nest, across the river, Ashiesteel, which, almost more
      eloquently than even Abbotsford itself, speaks of Sir Walter. Here were
      spent the seven happiest years of his life; here he wrote the "Lay of the
      Last Minstrel," "Marnuon," and "The Lady of the Lake"; here came into his
      service those most faithful of followers, Mathieson (his coachman) and Tom
      Purdie, the latter, before the good fortune that brought him to the notice
      of "the Shirra," a most accomplished poacher of <span class="pagenum">323</span><a
      name="link323" id="link323"></a>salmon. Who has not read, and smiled over,
      the tales that Scrope tells of him in his "Days and Nights of Salmon
      Fishing in Tweed?"

      Purdie's eccentricities were many, his tongue free and outspoken to an
      extent that one would suppose might at times have ruffled the temper even
      of a man so tolerant and sweet-tempered as Scott. Yet the attachment that
      sprang up between the three, Sir Walter, Mathieson, and Purdie, was of the
      deepest and most abiding, ending only with their lives. All men&mdash;all
      living things, one might say&mdash;loved Scott; these two adored him, and
      their master's affection for them, and his trust in them, were profound.
      Mathieson outlived the others; Purdie was the first to go. The end was
      very sudden, and the blow affected Sir Walter as if the death had been
      that of a near and dear relative. A niece of Mungo Park used to tell
      afterwards of Sir Walter's visit to the widow, as related by Mrs. Purdie
      herself. There came a tap at the door, she said, and he came silently in,
      sitting down without a word in the chair that Mrs. Purdie handed to him.
      And, "he juist grat, an' better grat, the tears rinnin' doon his cheeks."
      At last the poor woman said brokenly; "Ye mauna tak' on that way, Sir
      Walter. Ye mauna tak' on. Ye'll maybes get some other body juist as guid
      as Tam."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324" id="link324"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>No</i>, my dear old friend," he said, at length mastering his emotion.
      "No. There can never be but one Tom Purdie."
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth no one could, and no one ever did, replace him. A very few years,
      and Mathieson drove his master for the last time, that memorable drive in
      September, 1832, when the horses of their own accord stopped at his
      favourite view above Bemersyde; that September when the whole world
      mourned for him who was gone, who yet lives for ever, not alone in Border
      hearts, but in the affection of all humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sir Walter's day, no bridge spanned the river at Ashiesteel, and the
      ford was not always a safe one; Sir Walter and his horse on at least one
      occasion, when the water was heavy, had to swim when crossing. But "the
      Shirra" was always the most reckless of riders, and would plunge in where
      none dared follow. "The deil's in ye, Shirra," said Mungo Park's brother
      to him&mdash;not on one occasion only&mdash;"the deil's in ye. Ye'll never
      halt till they bring ye hame with your feet foremost." It was at this
      Ashiesteel ford that Leyden, when Sir Walter's guest, came to grief. He
      and "the Shirra," and Mr. Laidlaw of Peel were riding one day. Leyden was
      talking, as one having authority, of the paces and good manners of Arab
      horses, and telling tales of the marvellous skill with which their owners
      managed them. "Here," said he, gathering up his reins, "is one of their
      feats"&mdash;&mdash;; but just at that moment the pony on which he rode (<i>not</i>
      a docile Arab steed) took it into its head to bolt down the steep bank
      into Tweed, and Leyden disappeared over its head into the stream. "Ay, ay,
      Dr. Leyden, is <i>that</i> the way the Arabs ride?" said Laidlaw <span
      class="pagenum">325</span><a name="link325" id="link325"></a>gravely, when
      the rider reappeared, dripping like a river-god.

      Up the Glenkinnon Burn from Ashiesteel, at Williamhope Ridge, is the spot
      where Scott said his last farewell to Mungo Park. At the open drain which
      then separated moor from road, Park's horse stumbled badly. "A bad omen,
      Mungo, I'm afraid," said Sir Walter. "Freits (omens) follow them that fear
      them," cried Park, gaily, setting off<span class="pagenum">326</span><a

      "I stood and looked after him; but he never looked back," Scott used to
      tell, afterwards. And they met no more. Ere very many months had passed,
      Park lay dead, somewhere by that great African river with whose name his
      own will be for ever linked. But Williamhope has older memories than this;
      "William's Cross" was the name given to a great stone on the hill here,
      which marked the spot where the Knight of Liddes-dale fell, slain by his
      kinsman's sword one August day in 1353. <span class="pagenum">327</span><a
      name="link327" id="link327"></a>Quilting the neighbourhood of Ashiesteel,
      the road, in close company now with the railway from Galashiels to
      Peebles, still winds up the beautiful banks of Tweed, past Thornilee and
      Holylee, past boulder-strewn reaches and pleasant streams where big trout
      lie,&mdash;"a chancier bit ye canna hae," I think Stoddart says,&mdash;on
      past where, high on the farther side, overhanging the river, stand the
      crumbling ruins of Elibank Castle. This was a stronghold built&mdash;or
      possibly only enlarged&mdash;in 1595 by Sir Gideon Murray, father of
      Muckle Mouthed Meg, heroine of the story which tells how young Scott of
      Harden, caught reiving the Murrays' cattle, was given his choice between
      matrimony and the rope and "dule-tree." Harden, it is said, at first chose
      the latter, but at the last moment, as a mate scarcely to be preferred to
      death, took the lady. There was probably a good deal of bravado and
      "bluff" about Harden's wavering&mdash;if indeed the story is a true one.
      But in any case it was a wedding in which the proverb: "Happy the Wooing
      that's not long adoing," was well exemplified. All went well with bride
      and with reluctant bridegroom; they "lived happy ever after," as in the
      most orthodox fairy tale. And of their descendants, one was our own Sir
      Walter.

      And now we come to Walkerbum and Innerleithen, manufacturing townships.
      The latter, with its famed medicinal well, has been identified, or
      identifies itself, with St. Ronan's of the Waverley Novels. It is prettily
      situated on the Leithen, by wide spreading haughs, and the surroundings,
      like all in Tweedale, cannot fail to attract. But what may be said of

      said by the Tweed Pollution Commission is without exaggeration, and if&mdash;as
      one is informed&mdash;nothing has yet been done to sweep away, or at least

      of the river Leithen, a stream in former days called by Sir Thomas Dick

      The mills are supplied with water from the mill-lade, and one of them
      obtains water from the Tweed when necessary. The people of the town are
      entirely engaged in the woollen industry; wool scouring, weaving, and
      dyeing are all carried on here. The town is sewered. All the sewage is
      collected in an outfall sewer, which discharges into the mill-lade below
      the lowermost mill, and about three hundred yards from the Tweed; there is
      no attempt at purification of <span class="pagenum">330</span><a
      name="link330" id="link330"></a>the sewage. The liquid refuse from the
      mills is discharged into the lade. The water of the lade where it
      discharges to the Tweed is very foul with sewage and dye water... Below
      the point at which the lade discharges to the Tweed the water of this
      river is greatly fouled, the bottom of the river is covered with sewage
      deposit and the stones coated with sewage fungus. The river here contains
      also a large amount of refuse of all kinds, such as pots and pans, old
      linoleum, old iron-work, and such like. Although there is a daily
      collection of rubbish in the town, a great deal of large sized rubbish is
      thrown into the bed of the Lei then, and the tip to which all refuse is
      taken, together with offal from the slaughter houses, is situate just
      where the Lei then falls into the Tweed. In times of flood the water of
      the Leithen excavates this refuse tip, and carries the refuse into the
      Tweed. Some of the mill-owners here have tanks for settling the spent
      liquids after dyeing, and in this way some of the solid refuse is
      retained, but the coloured liquid is allowed to enter the river. One is
      thankful for small mercies; "<i>some</i> of the solid refuse is retained."
      But the "offal from the slaughter houses," and the "tip" to which all
      refuse is taken! And the sewage which there is "no attempt to purify"!
      What grizzly nightmare could be more grizzly than this?

      However, we get soon now above the range of pollution by mill or town.
      Peebles only remains; thereafter we have really a river as it used in its
      entirety to be, and, above Peebles, as it may still be called, "the silver
      Tweed." Before reaching Peebles, however, there is, over against
      Innerleithen, on the angle between Quair Burn and Tweed, Traquair House to
      notice; and, nearer to Peebles, on its green knoll the old riven tower of
      Horsburgh, ancient seat of an ancient family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of old, Traquair was a royal residence. In the twelfth century. William
      the Lion hunted from its tower; and other of the Scottish monarchs visited
      it in later days, the last, I suppose, being Mary and Darnley in August,
      1566. The original tower, <span class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331"
      id="link331"></a>or some part of it, I believe stands now in the
      north-east corner of the building, but the house has, of course, been
      greatly added to at different periods, mostly, however, during the reign
      of Charles I.

      It is a very fine specimen of the old Scottish château, with walls of
      immense thickness. Probably it is the oldest inhabited mansion house in
      Scotland; a place full of interest. And not least interesting, the
      picturesque old gates at the end of the avenue, that have remained so long
      unopened. The tale used to run that they had been closed after the '45, by
      an Earl loyal to the Stuart cause, who swore that they should never be
      opened till the rightful king came back to his own again. As a matter of
      fact, however, the misfortunes of Prince Charlie and his family had
      nothing to do with it. The gates were not closed till 1796, when the
      seventh Earl of Traquair, after the death of his countess, declared that
      they should remain shut till they opened to admit one worthy to take the
      dead lady's place. That, at least, is the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl who lived in the latter part of the seventeenth century belonged
      to the Church of Rome. "A quiet, inoffensive <span class="pagenum">332</span><a

      So a pious mob set out from Edinburgh one grim December day in 1688, and
      trudged through the snow to Traquair House. Earl and priest, having got
      word of their coming, had fled before the arrival of this gentle band of
      Reformers, and though they ransacked all Traquair for "Romish wares," they
      did not find all they expected. Much had been hidden away. The vestments
      of the priest this, that, and the other popish emblem could not be found.
      However, they did get a good deal&mdash;an altar, a large brazen crucifix,
      and several small crucifixes, "a large brodd opening with two leaves,
      covered within with cloth ot gold of Arras work, having a veil covering
      the middle part, wherin were sewed several superstitious pictures," a
      eucharist cup of silver, boxes of relics, "wherin were lying, amongst
      silk-cotton, several <span class="pagenum">334</span><a name="link334"
      id="link334"></a>pieces of bone, tied with a red thread, Having written on
      them the Saint they belonged to," "a harden bag, near full of beads,"
      "Mary and the Babe in a case most curiously wrought in a kind of pearl," a
      hundred and thirty books&mdash;silver-clasped many of them. No doubt the
      books, Popish or otherwise, excited to frenzy those pious but illiterate
      persons, almost as effectually as "the pot of holy oil," and the "twelve
      dozen of wax candles" that they seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content with all this, however, a detachment of the mob invaded the
      house of a neighbouring clergyman "who had the name of a Presbyterian
      minister." The orders given by their ringleaders were that this house
      should be narrowly searched, but that they themselves were to "behave
      discreetly," advice the latter part of which one might give with equal
      propriety and effect to the proverbial bull in a china shop. The Reverend
      Thomas Louis and his wife apparently did not treat the inquisitors with
      the kindness and consideration to which they thought themselves entitled;
      they "mocked them," it is complained; and indeed the minister and his wife
      carried their resentment so far as to offer them "neither food nor drink,
      though"&mdash;it is naively added&mdash;"they had much need of it."
      Undaunted, however, by this shabby conduct on the part of the reverend
      gentleman, the mob hunted about till they came on two locked trunks, which
      they demanded should at once be opened. This modest request not being
      complied with, they "broke up" the trunks&mdash;to "behave discreetly," is
      no doubt when desired, capable of liberal interpretation&mdash;and therein
      "they found a golden cradle, with Mary and the Babe in her bosom; in the
      other trunk, the priest's robes." So they made a pile of the articles
      found here and in Traquair House, carried them a distance of seven miles
      to Peebles, and had them "all solemnly burned at the cross." Such were the
      enlightened methods of our seventeenth century progenitors. But, one
      sometimes wonders, is the toleration of the mob now-a-days <span
      class="pagenum">335</span><a name="link335" id="link335"></a>greatly in
      advance of what was in 1688? However, they did not also "solemnly burn"
      Traquair House, though it <i>was</i> a "nest o'paipery."

      But the last Countess of Traquair has gone through the old gates; and her
      son, the eighth Earl, was the last of his line. He died, unmarried, in
      1861; and the last of her race, the venerable Lady Louisa Stuart, died in
      1875, in her hundredth year. Yet still, a pathetic link with days long
      dead, the old house stands brooding over the past; and still there sounds
      the music of the waters, and the sough of the wind in the trees of "the

    <p>
      More than any other of the Scottish border towns, Peebles has a right to
      talk of "royalty." A royal poet has sung of her Beltane Feast the evidence
      is at least as much for, as against, acceptance of the time-honoured <span
      class="pagenum">337</span><a name="link337" id="link337"></a>belief that
      King James I was author of "Peblis to the Play." Professor Veitch strongly
      favours that conclusion. And unbroken tradition points to the King as the
      author.
    </p>
    <p>
      From earliest times the town was a favourite residence of the Scottish
      monarchs, and to this day its place-names, such as King's Meadows, King's
      House, King's Orchards, for example, suggest royal traditions. The Burgh
      Records of Peebles, go back very far&mdash;to October 1456, in the reign
      of James II. It is a town of much interest and of much beauty, beautiful
      especially as regards its situation and surroundings, and there are still
      in it many remains that speak eloquently of the past. There is the old
      five-arched stone bridge, dating from about 1467, altered, of course, and
      widened since that date, but still the same old bridge. Until the erection
      of the bridge at Berwick early in the seventeenth century, I suppose that
      this was the only one spinning Tweed in all its course. Then there Is the
      ancient Cross of Peebles, which, after various vicissitudes and
      excursions, at length stands once more on the spot where it was originally
      placed. It is said by the writer of the Statistical Account of the Parish
      to have been "erected by one of the Frasers of Neidpath Castle, before the
      time of Robert the Bruce, and bears the arms of the Frasers."
    </p>
    <p>
      There are still to be seen within the burgh the ruins of the Cross Church,
      and of the Church of St. Andrew. The former got its name from the fact
      that in May, 1261, "a magnificent and venerable cross was found at
      Peblis," which was supposed to have been buried close on a thousand years
      before that date. Shortly after the unearthing of this cross, there was
      found near the same spot a stone urn, containing ashes and human bones,
      and on a stone the words carved: "The place of St. Nicholas the Bishop."
      On account of the miracles which were reputed to have been wrought where
      the cross was discovered, Alexander III caused a church to be erected on
      the spot, "in honour of God, and of the Holy Rood." This Cross Church in
      some unexplained way escaped practically unscathed during <span
      class="pagenum">338</span><a name="link338" id="link338"></a>the English
      invasion of 1548-49, and from 1560 till 1784 it served as the Parish
      Church&mdash;deprived, no doubt, of many an interesting relic of the past.
      At the last-named date, our zealous forefathers, <i>more majorum</i>,
      pulled it down&mdash;all but a fragment&mdash;in order, out of the
      material so obtained, to build a new Parish Church. (They had in those
      times a perfect genius for wrecking the beautiful and interesting, and for
      erecting the ugly and the dull.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The other old church, that of St. Andrew, was founded about the year 1195.
      It, however, unlike its neighbour, suffered badly at the hands of the
      English in 1548, after which it gradually fell into ruin, and met the fate
      that was wont to wait on most of our venerable Scottish buildings. The
      tower alone remained, impervious to wind and weather, defiant of man's
      destroying hand. Thirty years ago, it was restored by the late Dr. William
      Chambers,&mdash;"more honour to him had he been less successful in
      concealing the old work," says Sir Herbert Maxwell, in his "Story of the
      Tweed." It was in the Church of St. Andrew, tradition says, that
      Cromwell's troopers stabled their horses in 1650 when siege was being laid
      to Neidpath Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peebles at one time was a walled town, and I believe that some fragments
      of fortification remain. But the names: "Northgate," "Eastgate,"
      "Portbrae," still recall former days. There was a castle also, a royal
      residence; but though it yet stood in the end of the seventeenth century,
      or even a little later, there is now not a vestige of it to be found.
      Again, no doubt, the ruthless hand of our not very remote ancestors!
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting and very ancient custom continues to be observed in the
      town. Annually, on the second day of May, there is chosen from among the
      youthful beauties of Peebles one who is styled the "Beltane Queen"; and
      Beltane Sports and Festivities are held. Chambers says: "The festivities
      of Beltane originated in the ceremonial observances of the original
      British people, who lighted fires on the tops of hills and other <span
      class="pagenum">339</span><a name="link339" id="link339"></a>places in
      honour of their deity Baal; hence Beltane or Beltien, signifying the fire
      of Baal. The superstitious usage disappeared... but certain festive
      customs on the occasion were confirmed and amplified, and the rural sports
      of Beltane at Peebles, including archery and horse-racing... drew crowds
      not only from the immediate neighbourhood, but from Edinburgh and other
      places at a distance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peblis to the Play" is a description of the Festival as it was held in
      the day of the author; "a picture of rustic life and festivities, of the
      humorous and grotesque incidents of a mediaeval Feast Day in an old
      provincial town, the centre of a rural district," says Professor Veitch.

      Before moving on up the valley, one may recall the fact that at the Old
      Cross Keys Inn at Peebles Sir Walter found, in its then landlady, the
      original of his "Meg Dods" of "St. Ronan's Well." Guests arriving
      now-a-days at this Inn&mdash;which is as often called "the Cleikum" as the
      Cross Keys&mdash;still drive into the yard under the "old-fashioned
      archway" of the novel; still there is shown "Sir Walter's room,"
      overlooking the yard; and still, it may perhaps be noted, there is to be
      found at the head of affairs one who, while leaving out Meg's "detestable
      <span class="pagenum">340</span><a name="link340" id="link340"></a>bad
      humour" and asperity of tongue, in all essentials is worthy to rank as her
      successor. "Her kitchen was her pride and glory; she looked to the
      dressing of every dish herself, and there were some with which she
      suffered no one to interfere.... Meg's table-linen, bed-linen, and so
      forth, were always home-made, of the best quality, and in the best order;
      and a weary day was that to the chambermaid in which her lynx eye
      discovered any neglect of the strict cleanliness which she constantly
      enforced." The most fervent patriotism cannot, I fear, blind one to the
      sad fact that a majority of Scottish country inns do not strive very
      successfully to vie with Meg in those qualities which made her so shining
      an ornament of her sex. Too often one is left to the greasy attentions of
      a waiter of foreign tongue, whose mercies it might be desired were more
      tender than the scrag-end of the cold beef to which, in a parlour of the
      lethal-chamber variety, he somewhat tardily introduces tired wayfarers.
      And the beef itself might in many cases taste none the less of beef, if it
      were served on table-linen not quite so elaborately decorated with
      outlines of mustard pots and Worcester Sauce bottles, left by the
      day-beforeyesterday's commercial traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Cleikum, or Cross Keys Inn, is a building of more than respectable
      age; it dates from the year 1653, when it was the town house of the
      Williamsons of Cardrona, a tower a few miles down Tweed, nearly opposite
      to Horsburgh. Probably both the Cross Keys and its neighbour the Tontine
      Hotel&mdash;. Meg's "Tomteen," the "hottle" of which she spoke so
      wrathfully&mdash;were in Sir Walter's mind when he wrote the novel.

    <p>
      And now we may set out once again up Tweed&mdash;not forgetting, however,
      that Peebles with its mills also contributes no small share to the
      pollution of that much-injured river. A mile or so out of the town, there
      is the old castle of Neidpath, in very remote days a stronghold of the
      Frasers of Fruid and Oliver Castle, in Tweedsmuir. A Hay of Yester,
      ancestor of <span class="pagenum">341</span><a name="link341" id="link341"></a>Lord
      Tweeddale, succeeded the Frasers in 1312, by marriage with the daughter of
      Sir Simon Fraser;

      and after the Hays, by purchase came the Queensberry family, of whom, the
      fourth Duke, "Old Q.," Wordsworth's "Degenerate Douglas," <span
      class="pagenum">342</span><a name="link342" id="link342"></a>"unworthy
      lord," did his best to wreck the estate in 1795. What he could spoil and
      disfigure, he did spoil and disfigure. And here at Neidpath he swept off
      the face of nature every stick of timber, old and young, that could be
      felled or destroyed, leaving, as far as lay in his power, the landscape
      bare almost as it was when primeval chaos ended. Replanting could not be
      set about as long as "Old Q." lived, and a hundred years scarce repaired
      the damage he did. It is curious to note how one who in all respects
      during his life was so very far removed from grace, at the end wished to
      lie (where I believe his body does lie), under the Communion Table of St.
      James's Church, Piccadilly&mdash;in his estimation perhaps a sort of
      side-gate or private entrance to Heaven. The path is steep and the way
      thorny to most of us. And how fares "Old Q."? I hardly think that the
      inhabitants of Peebles, had they been Roman Catholics at the time of his
      death, would have paid for Masses for the soul of the dead "Old Q.," as
      they did lang syne for the soul of the dead King James the First.

    <p>
      Neidpath Castle is said by old Dr. Pennecuick to have been in reality the
      stronghold which was anciently called the Castle of Peebles. But there are
      allusions to the "Castel of Peebles" in the Earl of Tweeddale's Rental
      book for 1685, and Neidpath was Neidpath centuries before that date. On
      this subject, Professor Veitch, writing about 1877, says: "The Castle of
      Peebles was standing and inhabited in the early part of last century. It
      was afterwards pulled down, and the materials converted, according to the
      morality and taste of the time, into one of the least architecturally
      attractive palish edifices in Christendom." As to Neidpath's age, there is
      no sure record, but as it was a seat of that Sir Simon Fraser who defeated
      the English three times in one day at Roslin Muir in 1303, its antiquity
      must be very great. And what a place of immense strength it must
      originally have been, before the days of artillery. Its walls are ten feet
      thick, put together with that <span class="pagenum">343</span><a
      name="link343" id="link343"></a>ancient form of cement which, when dry,
      became hard as the stones it bound together; and it stands on a high rock
      overhanging an elbow of Tweed where the water is deep, and was therefore
      on the river face unassailable.

      But the day of artillery came too soon for Neidpath. It fell before the
      guns of Cromwell in 1650. after a most gallant resistance under the young
      Lord Yester,&mdash;father, I suppose, of the Lord Yester who wrote the
      fine old ballad "Tweedside."
    </p>
    <p>
      Like every other part of the Yale of Tweed, here also it is beautiful.
      Looking back towards Peebles from above Neidpath the view is very fine,
      though perhaps an eyesore may be found in the unwholesome speckled
      appearance given to the castle by the way in which the "facing" of its
      walls has been done.

      Little more than a mile from here, Tweed is joined by Manor Water, a
      stream now probably best known as that beside which stands the cottage of
      "Bowed Davie," the original of Scott's "Black Dwarf" of Mucklestane Muir.
      Sir Walter was staying at Hallyards, on Manor Water, in 1797, with his
      friend Adam Ferguson, and it was on that occasion that he first saw <span
      class="pagenum">344</span><a name="link344" id="link344"></a>David
      Ritchie, a poor mis-shapen dwarf, embittered by the derision which his
      extraordinary personal appearance everywhere brought on him, and who had
      retired to this unfrequented valley, where he built himself a cottage of
      dimensions in keeping with his own stature.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0364.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The cottage still stands, "where from his bole the awsome form peer'd grim
      on passer-bye," but at least the exterior has been modernised, and an
      addition has been made; his garden wall, with its ponderous stones, is
      much as Bowed Davie left it. The "Black Dwarf" was not written till a good
      many years after Ritchie's death. His grave is in Manor Kirkyard, not, as
      he himself originally meant it to be, in a secluded spot of his own
      choice, surrounded by the rowan-trees that it comforted him to think could
      be relied on to keep witches, and evil spirits generally, at a respectable
      distance. Poor Davie! There were worse things than witches to be taken
      <span class="pagenum">345</span><a name="link345" id="link345"></a>into
      account. It is said&mdash;Dr. John Brown mentions it&mdash;that his body
      proved a temptation too great to be resisted by resurrectionists. They dug
      him up, and carried the poor "thrawn" frame to where it could be sold.
      Perhaps in death he still excites that derision or pity which in life so
      angered him; his bones may now lie in some city anatomical museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the Vestry of Manor Parish Kirk, there is, accord ing to the
      Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland edited by Mr. F. H. Groome, "a table made
      of oak that had been used for church building not later than the
      thirteenth century; and a bell in the belfry bears the Latin inscription:
      'In honore Sanct. Gordiani MCCCCLXXVIII.'" And far up the vale, near
      Kirkhope, is the site of this St. Gordian's Kirk, "marked by a granite
      runic cross, with the old font stone at its base."

      Manor Valley in days of old must have been a "mischancey" spot for any
      stranger whose intentions were, so to speak, not "strictly honourable."
      There were, in and about it, not fewer than nine or ten peel towers, two
      at least of which&mdash;Barns and Castlehill&mdash;belonged to the
      Burnets, than whom none bore higher reputation as reivers and men of
      action. In 1591 no Borderer was more renowned for his exploits and for his
      conduct of midnight forays, than William Burnet, the "Hoolet of Barns."
      His tower, Barns, is rather nearer Tweed than Manor, but it is included in
      the strongholds of Manor Valley. It is still in excellent preservation,
      but the roof is modern, and the upper part of the tower has been greatly
      altered from what it was originally. The accommodation in such towers must
      have been something of the most cramped; in this instance the outside
      dimensions of the tower (three stories) are only twenty-eight by twenty
      feet. On the lintel of the door is the date 1498, but there appears to be
      some uncertainty as to whether the figures were not added at a later time.
      Castlehill, now a ruin, "hollow-eyed, owl-haunted," was somewhat larger
      and stronger than Barns. Higher up the valley is Posso, now mere fragments
      of walls. It was of old a <span class="pagenum">346</span><a name="link346"
      id="link346"></a>seat of the Bairds, who were succeeded in the sixteenth
      century by the Naesmiths.

      At Posso Craigs was the eyry whence Henry Ashton in the "Bride of
      Lammermuir" got his hawks. And here under the craigs is the Ship Stone.
      The whole valley teems with objects of antiquarian interest&mdash;the
      tumulus called the Giants' Grave, up Glenrath Burn; the "cup-marked fallen
      monolith," that was once an old woman whom the devil turned into stone;
      the old Thiefs Road, trodden of old by many a mob of "lifted" cattle;
      numerous hill forts. And from the bosom of the wild hills springs Manor; a
      tiny rivulet from Dollar Law&mdash;(is "Dollar" a corruption of "Dolour,"
      the Hill of Sorrow?)&mdash;from Notman Law another; infantile rills from
      Shielhope Head, Black Law, Blackhouse Heights, grim round-shouldered hills
      that rise all of them to a greater altitude than two thousand feet. And
      everywhere is the music of running water.

      <span class="pagenum">347</span><a name="link347" id="link347"></a>Cademuir,
      by the way, the hill on Manor's right at its junction with Tweed, is the
      supposed scene of Arthur's seventh battle against the Pagans. <i>Cad</i>
      is Welsh for battle,&mdash;Gaelic, <i>cata</i>, hence <i>Cad-more</i>, the
      "great battle." Professor Veitch hesitates between this site and that of
      the neighbouring pre-historic hill fort, the Lour, near Dawyck, but thinks
      the former the more probable. Just below the height of the Lour, till the
      beginning of the nineteenth century there stood, he says, an almost
      perfect <i>cromlech</i>, consisting of "two or more upright stones, and
      one flat stone laid across as a roof, all of remarkable size." This <i>cromlech</i>
      was known in the district as Arthur's Oven. It is humiliating to have to
      confess that it, the neighbouring old peel tower of Easter Dawyck, the
      Tower of Posso, and the ancient Kirk of St. Gordian, were all made into
      road metal, or used as material for building walls or farm buildings, by
      Sir Walter Scott's father, of all people in the world. One may wonder what
      were Sir Walter's thoughts when he came to know.

      A little way up from Manor Valley, and joining Tweed from the northern
      side, is Lyne Water. It is not possible to pursue all Tweed's tributaries
      to their source, however full of interest each may be, for their name is
      legion. But Lyne cannot be passed without note being taken of its little&mdash;very
      little&mdash;early seventeenth century Parish Church. And adjoining it are
      remains of a great Roman camp&mdash;Randall's Wa's, i: has been called
      locally from times long past. Perhaps it was here&mdash;at least it was on
      Lyne Water&mdash;that Sir James Douglas captured Randolph before the time
      came when the latter finally cast in his lot with the Bruce. Farther up,
      on an eminence at the junction of Lyne and Tartli Waters, stands the
      massive ivy-clad ruin of Drochil Castle. Built by the Regent Morton in the
      sixteenth century, Drochil was never completed, and never occupied. Just
      before the building approached completion, Morton, judged guilty of
      complicity in the murder of Darnley, was executed, beheaded by "the
      Maiden"&mdash;a sort of Scottish <span class="pagenum">348</span><a
      name="link348" id="link348"></a>guillotine&mdash;on 2nd June, 1581; and
      the home of a Regent of Scotland, "designed more for a palace than a
      castle of defence," is now a rum, of use only as a shelter for cattle!

      Happrew, on Lyne, is the scene of the defeat "wrought by the lords William
      de Lalymer, John de Segrave, and Robert de Clifford, upon Simone Fraser
      and William le Walleys at Hopperowe," in 1304. And on the elevated heathy
      flat below which Tweed and Lyne meet, there is what is called the
      Sheriff's Muir, of old a mustering place for Scottish forces during the
      wars with England.

    <p>
      And now, as we run up Tweed's left bank, we have on the one side Stobo,
      with its ancient church&mdash;of which mention has been made earlier in
      this volume&mdash;and its fine woods; on the other bank, Dawyck, and the
      castles of Tinnies and Drummelzier. From the thirteenth well on into the
      seventeenth century, Dawyck was the home of a distinguished Tweedside
      family, the Veitches, once the Le Vaches, of Gascony, of whom one, William
      le Vache, signed the Ragman Roll at the Castle of Peebles in 1296. At the
      same time that <span class="pagenum">349</span><a name="link349"
      id="link349"></a>the Veitches held Dawyck, Drummelzier was the
      headquarters of another powerful Border family, the Tweedys; and for the
      delicate questions involved in the origin of this family's name, readers
      may consult Sir Walter's introduction to "The Betrothed." Of necessity, as
      things went in those days, these two families quarrelled, and from the
      quarrel emerged a feud long and bloody, in which, ere it ended, half the
      countryside was involved. Wherever a Veitch and a Tweedy met, they fought,
      and fought to kill. On the haughs of the river one summer's day, young
      Veitch and young Tweedy, each, perhaps, looking for trouble, came together
      face to face. The grey of next morning saw of the latter but

      In 1590, the head of the Veitches, "the Deil o' Dawyck," an immensely
      powerful man, had for his ally William Burnet, "the Hoolet o' Barns," a
      man equally powerful. These two daunted the Tweedy of that day; the feud
      for a space lay-dormant. But, most unhappily for the Veitches, it chanced
      that "the Deil's" son rode into Peebles alone one morning. And that was
      the end of young Veitch. For nine Tweedys, in two parties, trapped him
      near Neidpath, came on him in front and from the rear as he rode towards
      home; and it was no fight, but bloody murder that reddened the grass that
      day. Four days later, two Veitches met John Tweedy, Tutor of Drummelzier,
      in the High Street of Edinburgh, and young Veitch's bloody death was
      avenged; "a tooth for a tooth," no matter how many were concerned in its
      drawing. And so it <span class="pagenum">350</span><a name="link350"
      id="link350"></a>went on <i>ad nauseam</i>, a Veitch killing a Tweedy, a
      Tweedy a Veitch. The feud was alive even as late as 1611; and for anything
      that I know to the contrary, it endured as long as the two families were
      there to neighbour each other on Tweedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Drummelzier Castle only an angle of the tower and a portion of the main
      building now stand. It was here that there dwelt that arrogant bully, Sir
      James Tweedy, who of old was wont to exact homage from every passing
      traveller; and the traveller who omitted to, so to speak, "lower his
      tops'ls" as he passed the castle, had cause to rue the day the fates took
      him that way. It was a pretty enough game from Tweedy's point of view.
      But, as the saying is, one day he "bit off more than he could chew." A
      stranger, attended by a very small retinue, passed up the valley without
      taking the smallest notice of the castle or its formidable owner. Foaming
      with rage, spluttering dire threats, Tweedy and his men went thundering in
      pursuit; truly, the back of that stranger should smart to some tune. But,
      just as you may see the birses and tail of a vicious, snarling cur drop
      when he finds he has inadvertently rushed out against a bigger dog than
      himself, so here, Tweedy's mood changed with astonishing celerity when he
      jumped from his horse beside the man he had been cursing and bawling at to
      stop, and found that the fugitive he was vowing to flog was his king,
      James V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tinnies Castle was also a holding of the Tweedys, possibly before the
      building of Drummelzier. This castle is believed to date from the
      thirteenth century, or perhaps earlier, and it seems to have been a place
      of considerable size and of great strength. "In no part of Scotland was
      there any feudal keep so like a robber's castle on the Rhine, as that of
      Tinnis," says Chambers. The building was destroyed under royal warrant in
      1592, at the time when the King issued orders to raze Dry hope and Harden.
      The position of Tinnies is immensely strong. Perched on a lofty eminence,
      three of whose sides are almost perpendicular and the fourth a long steep
      slope, the <span class="pagenum">351</span><a name="link351" id="link351"></a>castle
      in its day must have been almost unassailable. Any approach to the walls
      could only be made in force by a narrow winding pathway, within shot of,
      and fully exposed to, the castle bowmen, and the building itself, as may
      even yet be noted, was of a solidity truly formidable. Immense portions of
      the walls and flanking towers, yet bound by the old imperishable cement,
      still lie where they were bodily hurled by the exploding gunpowder when
      James VI's orders were carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Dawyck and its magnificent woods one must not forget to take note. Here
      in 1725 were planted the first larches introduced into Scotland,
      anticipating it is said, by a few years those planted at Dunkeld. And
      while on the subject of natural history, one may perhaps quote that most
      notable fact regarding Dawyck which Dr. Pennecuick, writing in the early
      eighteenth century, vouches for in his "Shire of Tweeddale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," says he, "in an old Orch-yard did the Herons in my time build
      their Nests upon some old Pear-trees, whereupon in the Harvest time are to
      be seen much Fruit growing, and Trouts and Iles crauling down the Body of
      these Trees. These fish the Herons take out of the River of Tweed to their
      Nests, and as they go in at the Mouth, so they are seen squirt out again
      at the Draught. And this is the remarkable Riddle they so much talk of, to
      have Flesh, Fish, and Fruit at the same time upon one tree." There is
      still a heronry at Dawyck, but not, I think, in an "Orch-yard."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the neighbourhood of Drummelzier there is a spot that takes us back in
      thought to those dim, far off days when the world was in its infancy. Near
      to where Powsayl Burn, the "burn of the willows," joins Tweed, you may see
      the grave of Merlin the Seer, the Wizard Merlin. Fleeing from the field of
      Arderydd (Arthuret, near Carlisle), after the terrible defeat of the
      Pagans by the Christians in 573, Merlin found refuge among the hills of
      Upper Tweed, and there lived for many years, half-crazed, a homeless
      wanderer. Finally, the fear <span class="pagenum">352</span><a
      name="link352" id="link352"></a>raised by his supposed possession of
      supernatural powers, and the dread of his enchantments, caused a mob of
      ignorant country-folk to club and stone him to death, and he was buried
      where he fell, by the Powsayl burn. In a poem still extant, Merlin tells
      how he wandered long in the wild wood of Caledon.

      The place of the "apple tree" was Tal Ard&mdash;Talla of to-day; and
      somewhere between Drummelzier and Talla, Merlin and St. Kentigern
      foregathered for a time. High up on the mighty shoulder of broad law, too,
      there is a spring that gushes out from the hillside clear and cool, that
      may be the fountain&mdash;<i>fons in summo vertice montis</i>&mdash;beside
      which Geoffrey of Monmouth in 1150 tells that Merlin was wont to rest. And
      the "fair sportive maid"&mdash;that is Nimiane, Tennyson's "Vivien." A
      Romance of the fifteenth century tells how "Thei sojourned together longe
      time, till it fell on a day that thei went thourgh the foreste hande in
      hande devysing and disportynge, and this was in the foreste of
      Brochelonde, and fonde a bussh that was feire and high of white hawthorne,
      full of floures, and ther thei sat in the shadowe; and Merlin leide hys
      heed in the damesels lappe, and she began to taste softly till he fill on
      slepe; and when she felt that he was on slepe she aroos softly, and made a
      cerne (circle) with hys wymple all aboute the bussh and all aboute Merlin,
      and began hir enchantementes soche as Merlin hadde hir taught, and made
      the cerne ix tymes, and ix tymes her enchantementes; and after that she
      wente and satte down by hym and leide hys heed <span class="pagenum">353</span><a
      name="link353" id="link353"></a>in hir lappe, and hilde hym ther till he
      dide awake; and then he looked aboute hym, and hym semed he was in the
      feirest tour of the worlde, and the most stronge, and fonde hym leide in
      the feirest place that ever he lay beforn.... Ne never after com Merlin
      out of that fortresse that she hadde hym in sette; but she wente in and
      oute whan she wolde." Not far from the churchyard of Drummelzier to this
      day they point out the grave where Merlin lies beneath a thorn tree. And
      to everyone is known Thomas the Rhymer's prediction:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "When Tweed and Powsayl meet at Merlin's grave
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Scotland and England shall one monarch have,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and how the prophecy was fulfilled that same day on which James of
      Scotland was crowned King of England. For Tweed then so overflowed its
      banks that burn and river joined beside the spot where Merlin lies, which,
      as Dr. Pennecuick says, "was never before observed to fall out, nor since
      that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Over against Drummelzier, Biggar Water falls into Tweed, and a curious
      circumstance about this stream is this, that "on the occasion of a large
      flood... the Clyde actually pours a portion of its water mto one of the
      tributaries of Tweed." The whole volume of Clyde at Biggar, says Sir
      Archibald Geikie, could without any difficulty be made to flow into Tweed
      by way of the Biggar Water. The latter at one point is separated from
      Clyde by but one and a half miles of almost level ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this region of Biggar Water is rich in remains of old towers and
      camps; but of the most important, that of Boghall Castle at Biggai, seat
      of the great Fleming family, Lords Fleming in 1460, there is now
      practically nothing left standing; the customary fate, the fate that so
      long dogged most Scottish historical buildings overtook in about sixty or
      seventy years ago. It was a place of strength in 1650, when Cromwell's men
      held it; a sketch done in 1779 by John Clerk of Eldin, shows that it was
      then entire, or almost entire, and it stood, a fine ruin, as lately as
      1831, when Sir Walter and Lockhart were at Biggar. <span class="pagenum">354</span><a
      name="link354" id="link354"></a>With what devilish energy since then must
      the wreckers have laboured to destroy! Of Biggar Moss, Blind Harry tells
      the wondrous tale of how Wallace, with a diminutive Scottish force, smote
      here in 1279 a large English army led by Edward I; eleven thousand
      Englishmen were slain, says the veracious poet. And if corroboration of
      Blind Harry be needed, why is there not standing here, as witness to this
      very day, the Cadger's Brig, over which, as local tradition vouches,
      Wallace, disguised as a hawker, crossed on his way to spy out the weak
      points in Edward's camp! As with most Border places, there is no lack of
      interest about Biggar, but considerations of space forbid any attempt to
      treat of its history. Yet it must not be omitted that here was born a man
      greatly loved in Scotland, Dr. John Brown, best known to the outside
      world, perhaps, as the author of "Rab and his Friends."

      CHAPTER XV BROUGHTON, TWEEDSMUIR, TALLA, GAMESHOPE, TWEED'S WELL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>eturning<span
      class="pagenum">355</span><a name="link355" id="link355"></a> to the
      neighbourhood of Tweed, on the bank of a little burn tributary to Biggar
      Water stands the village of Broughton, reminiscent of Mr. "Evidence"
      Murray, the Prince's Secretary, who saved his own life after the '45 by
      turning King's Evidence. Broughton House, his old home, was burned to the
      ground about 1775, (a couple of years prior to Murray's death on the
      Continent,) and the estate was afterwards sold to the famous Lord
      Braxfield, the original of Stevenson's "Weir of Hermiston." Higher up
      Tweed, on the farther bank, is Stanhope, in the eighteenth century the
      property of Murray of Broughton's nephew, Sir David Murray, who lost his
      all in the '45; and not many miles farther up the river is Polmood, where
      the dishonoured uncle lay hid, and was taken, in June 1746, losing
      thereafter more than the life he saved&mdash;honour and the respect of his
      fellow men. "Neither lip of me nor of mine comes after Mr. Murray of
      Broughton's!" cried Sir Walter Scott's father as he threw out of window
      the cup from which the apostate had but then drunk tea. And:&mdash;"Do you
      know this witness?" was asked of Sir John Douglas of Kelhead, a prisoner
      after the '45, before the Privy Council at St. James's, when Murray was
      giving evidence. "Not I," said Douglas, "I once knew a person who bore the
      designation of Murray of Broughton,&mdash;but that was a gentleman and a
      man of honour, and one that could hold up his head!" <span class="pagenum">356</span><a
      name="link356" id="link356"></a>Of old, Polmood&mdash;the name, I believe,
      means the "wolf's burn," or stream&mdash;was a hunting seat of Scottish
      kings; In times more modern it was chiefly remarkable for an interminable
      law plea which dragged its weary length along for forty years and more,
      probably in the end with ruin to both parties to the suit. Before coming
      to Polmood, however, we pass Mossfennan, sung of in two ballads, one of
      the seventeenth century, the other (of which but a fragment remains) of
      much more ancient date. On the roadside a little further up is a sign-post
      that points dejectedly towards a dilapidated-looking tree which stands
      solitary on the haugh below. Here, says the legend on the post, was the
      site of Linkumdoddie, whereof Burns wrote a song. But to find any point of
      interest in the scene, or in the identity of Linkumdoddie or of the lady
      celebrated, t requires, I think, that the gazer should be possessed of a
      most perfervid admiration of the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we begin to open up the wilder part of Tweed's valley, where not
      so many years ago you might go a long way, and for miles see no human
      being but a passing shepherd. It is different now, in these days when
      motor-cars, leaving behind them a trail of dust as ugly as the smudge of a
      steamer's smoke low down on the horizon, rush along what used to be the
      finest of old grass-grown coach-roads, smooth as a billiard-table and free
      from any loose metal&mdash;swept bare now to the very roots of the stones
      by the constant air-suction of passing cars. But even now, in the
      winter-time, when the rush of the tourist troubles no more, if one trusts
      oneself in these wilds, there is a reward to be gleaned in the fresh,
      inexpressibly <i>clean</i> air, and in the sense of absolute freedom that
      one gains. You have-left civilisation and its cares behind; here is peace.
      And in the great hills lying there so solemn and still, black as blackest
      ink where the heather stands out against the wintry grey sky, or
      deep-slashed on their sides with heavy drifts of snow from the latest
      storm, there is rest to the wearied soul and the tired <span
      class="pagenum">357</span><a name="link357" id="link357"></a>mind. And if
      the day be windless, what sweeter sound can anywhere be heard than the
      tinkling melody of innumerable burns blending with the deeper note of
      Tweed? Nowhere in the world, as it seems to me, is there any scene where
      Nature lays on man a hand so gentle as here in Tweedsmuir. It is all one,
      the season; no matter if the air is still, or the west wind bellows down
      the valley, life is better worth living for the being here. And the glory
      of it, when snow lies deep over the wide expanse, and the sun shines
      frostily, and Tweed, black by contrast with the stainless snow, goes
      roaring his hoarse song seaward!
    </p>
    <p>
      All burns up this part of the valley used to teem with nice, fat, lusty
      yellow trout&mdash;Stanhope Burn, Polmood, Hearthstane, Talla and
      Gameshope, Menzion, Fruid, Kingledores (with its memories of St.
      Cuthbert), and the rest. Doubtless the trout are there still, but most of
      the burns are now in the hands of shooting tenants, and the fishing,
      probably, is not open to all as of old. Talla and Gameshope (of which more
      anon) are now the property of the Edinburgh Water Trust Commissioners, and
      a permit from them is necessary if one would fish in these two streams or
      in Talla Reservoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before reaching Talla, almost equidistant between the Polmood and
      Hearthstane burns, but on the opposite side of Tweed, we come to what used
      to be the cheery, clean little Crook Inn, standing in its clump of trees.
      But its history of two hundred years and more as an inn is ended; modern
      legislation has seen to that. And there is now on this highroad between
      Peebles and Moffat&mdash;a distance of something like thirty miles&mdash;not
      a single house where man and beast may find accommodation and reasonable
      refreshment. It is not the so-called "idle rich" who are thus handicapped;
      fifteen or sixteen miles are of small account to the man who owns a
      motor-car. It is they who<span class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358"
      id="link358"></a> cannot afford the luxury of a car, but who yet desire to
      be alone here with nature, or to fish in Tweed and in such burns as may
      yet be fished, it is they who find themselves thus left out in the cold. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Since this was written, the Crook has reopened its doors
     as an inn. But they are not any longer content with the
     homely word "inn"; the place asserts itself now in large
     letters as the Crook "Hotel."
</pre>
    <p>
      Of old, when the mail-coaches running between Dumfries and Edinburgh came
      jingling cheerily along this smooth Tweed-side road, it was at the Crook
      Inn that they changed horses. But I doubt it was not then a spot so
      inviting as it certainly became in the 'seventies of last century. Sir
      Thomas Dick Lauder speaks of it as it was in 1807 as "one of the
      coldest-looking, cheerless places of reception for travellers that we had
      ever chanced to behold.... It stood isolated and staring in the midst of
      the great glen of the Tweed, closed in by high green sloping hills on all
      sides.... No one could look at it without thinking of winter, snow-storms,
      and associations filled with pity for those whose hard fate it might be to
      be storm-stayed there." But Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's visit in 1807 was
      paid in the month of November, when snow hung heavy in the air,
      threatening the traveller with wearisome and indefinite delay. And the
      hind wheels of his chaise collapsed like the walls of Jericho as the
      postillion, having changed horses here, started with too sudden a dash
      from the door of the inn; and Sir Thomas was bumped most grievously along
      the road for some hundreds of yards ere the post-boy (who perhaps had made
      use at the Crook of some far-seeing device to keep out the cold)
      discovered that anything was amiss. Not unnaturally the nerves of the
      occupants of the chaise were a trifle rallied; no doubt the place then
      looked less cheerful than it might otherwise have appeared. Forty years
      later, he writes that it had, "comparatively speaking, an inviting air of
      comfort about it.... The road, as you go along, now wears altogether an
      inhabited look, and little portions of plantations here and there give an
      air of shelter and civilisation to it." It was a cheerless place enough,
      no doubt, in the Covenanting <span class="pagenum">359</span><a
      name="link359" id="link359"></a>days of the seventeenth century, when the
      dour hill-men were flying from Claverhouse's dragoons, lurking in the
      black, oozing "peat-hags," hiding by the foaming burns, sheltering on the
      wild moors, amongst the heather and the wet moss. It was the landlady of
      this same Crook Inn who found for one fugitive a novel hiding hole; she
      built him safely into her stack of peats. There has been many a less
      comfortable and less secure hitting place than that; and where could one
      drier be found?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the Crook that William Black makes his travellers in the
      "Strange Adventures of a Phaeton" spend a night, and the fare to which in
      the evening he sets his party down was certainly of the frugalest. But
      when this present writer knew the inn in the 'seventies, it was far from
      being only on "whisky and ham and eggs" that he was obliged to subsist. It
      was then an ideal angler's haunt; and no more gentle lullaby can be
      imagined than the low murmur of Tweed, and the quiet <i>hus-s-s sh</i> of
      many waters breathing down the valley on the still night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mile or more beyond the Crook, there is the Bield, also once an inn
      "From Berwick to the Bield," is the Tweedside equivalent of the Scriptural
      "From Dan even to Beer-sheba." It was here at the Bield that the
      Covenanters thought once to trap Claverhouse; but that "proud Assyrian"
      rode not easily into snares. On the hill above is the site of Oliver
      Castle, home of the Fraser family, once so powerful in this part of the
      Border&mdash;the site, I think, but nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, to reach that part of Tweedsmuir which more than any other casts
      over one a spell, it is necessary to branch off here to the left and
      follow the road shown in Mr. Thomson's charming sketch. Straight ahead of
      you, as you stand by the little Tweedsmuir post-office, you look up the
      beautiful valley of the Talla, where the steep hills lie at first open and
      green and smiling on either hand, but gradually changing their character,
      close in, gloomy and scarred, and <span class="pagenum">360</span><a

      neared.

      But before you leave the little hamlet of Tweedsmuir&mdash;it can scarcely
      be called a village&mdash;by the old single-arched bridge that is thrown
      here across Tweed, where he roars and chafes among his rocks <span
      class="pagenum">361</span><a name="link361" id="link361"></a>ere plunging
      down into the deep, black pool below, you will see on your left a spire

      That is the church of Tweedsmuir, on its strange, tumulus-like mound by
      the river's brink. And here you will find:n the green grass, under the
      clustering trees, the graves of some who fell for "The Covenant," one
      headstone, at least, relettered by "Old <span class="pagenum">362</span><a

      one John Hunter; but doubless there are others, less noticeable, who rest
      with him in this quiet spot, far from the world's clash and turmoil, where
      no sound harsher than the Sabbath bell that calls to prayer or the sighing
      of the wind in the trees, can ever break the silence. Here is Hunter's

      Sometimes it strikes one as strange, that passion for listening to a
      sermon which is inherent in one's countrymen. It is but a sombre pleasure,
      as a rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talla, up to a recent period, flowed through a deep valley, whose bottom
      for some distance was of a treacherous and swampy nature; its trout,
      therefore, (in marked contrast to those of the tributary Gameshope,) were
      dark-coloured and "ill-faured." I do not know that they are anything else
      now, but there is not much of Talla left. A mile above the church you come
      to a great barrier thrown across the valley, and beyond that for three
      miles stretches a Reservoir which supplies distant Edinburgh with water.
      Picturesque enough in its way is this Reservoir, especially when all trace
      of man and his work is left behind, and nothing meets the eye but the
      brown, foam-flecked water, and the hills plunging headlong deep into its
      bosom. Even more picturesque is the scene when storms gather on the far
      heights, and come raging down the wild glen of Gameshope, swathing in mist
      and scourging rain-squall the <span class="pagenum">364</span><a
      name="link364" id="link364"></a>deep-scarred brows of those eerie hills by
      Talla Linn-foot. What a spot it must be on a wild December day, when blind
      ing snow drives down the gullies before the icy blast!
    </p>
    <p>
      This Reservoir has been stocked with Loch Leven trout. But the fishing is
      not, and never will be, good. There is insufficient food; the water is too
      deep, and except at the extreme head of the loch there are no shallows
      where insect life might hatch out. The trout are long and lank, and seldom
      fight well. Nor are they even very eager to rise to the fly. Yet, it is
      true, some large fish have been taken. But they have a suspiciously
      cannibal look, and I think an insurance company would be apt to charge a
      very high premium on the chances of long life of troutlings now put in.

      I do not know where Young Hay of Talla lived. If his peel tower was here,
      no doubt the site is now sixty or seventy feet under water, but I cannot
      remember any traces of a building, or site of a building, in pre-Reservoir
      days. Men born and brought up lang syne on the gloomy slopes of Talla,
      might well be such as he, fierce and cruel, ready for treason and murder,
      or any crime of violence.

      If you would gain a good idea of this part of Tweedsmuir, climb by the
      steep, crumbling sheep-path that scales the Linn-side, till you reach the
      spot where Mr. Thomson has made his sketch of the Reservoir. There, lying
      on the heather by the sounding waters, or beneath the rowan trees where
      blaeberries cluster thick among the rocks, you may picture to yourself a
      meeting that took place by this very spot two hundred and thirty-one years
      ago. On commanding heights, solitary men keeping jealous watch lest
      Claver'se's hated dragoons should have smelled out the place of meeting;
      below, where the Linn's roar muffles the volume of other sounds, a company
      of blue-bonneted, stern-faced men, singing with intense fervour some
      militant old Scottish Psalm, followed by long and earnest <span
      class="pagenum">366</span><a name="link366" id="link366"></a>extempore
      prayer, and renewed Psalms; and presently then falling into dispute as

      This was that celebrated meeting of Covenanters in 1682, of which Sir
      Walter Scott, writing in <span class="pagenum">367</span><a name="link367"
      id="link367"></a>"The Heart of Midlothian," says: "Here [at Talla] the
      leaders among the scattered adherents, to the Covenant, men who, in their
      banishment from human society, and in the recollection of the severities
      to which they had been exposed, had become at once sullen in their
      tempers, and fantastic in their religious opinions, met with arms in their
      hands, and by the side of the torrent discussed, with a turbulence which
      the noise of the stream could not drown, points of controversy as empty
      and unsubstantial as its foam." Dour men they were, and intolerant, our

      If, as Sydney Smith has said, "it is good for any man to be alone with
      nature and himself"; if "it is well to be in places where man is little
      and God is great"; then assuredly it is well to be alone, or with a friend
      "who knows when silence is more sociable than talk," up in the great
      solitude by Gameshope Burn. Nowhere in Scotland can one find a glen wilder
      or more impressive, nowhere chance on a scene which more readily helps the
      harassed mind to slip from under the burden of worldly cares. For half a
      mile or more from its mouth hut a commonplace, open, boulder-strewn
      mountain burn, above that point the broken, craggy hills fall swiftly to
      the lip of a brawling torrent, which drops foaming by linn after linn deep
      into the seething black cauldrons below, lingers there a minute, then
      hurries swiftly onward by cliff and fern-clad mossy bank. Above each pool
      cling rowan trees, rock rooted, a blaze of scarlet and orange if the month
      be September, but beautiful always at whatever season you may visit them.
      Everywhere the air is filled with the deep murmur and crash of falling
      waters; yet, clamber to that lonely old track which leads to the solitary
      cottage of a shepherd, and around you is a silence <span class="pagenum">368</span><a
      name="link368" id="link368"></a>almost oppressive, emphasised rather than
      broken by the ill-omened croak of a raven, or by the thin anxious bleat of
      a ewe calling to its lamb from far up the mountain side.

      A mile past the shepherd's substantially built little house&mdash;it had
      need be strong of frame to stand intact up here against the winter storms&mdash;on
      your left is Donald's Cleuch, reminiscent of the Reverend Donald Cargill,
      a hero of the Covenant, Minister of the Barony Church in Glasgow in 1655,
      who was <span class="pagenum">369</span><a name="link369" id="link369"></a>afterwards
      deprived of his benefice for denouncing the Restoration. The legend is, I
      presume, that Cargill hid somewhere in the wild moorland hereabout, up the
      Donald's Cleuch burn perhaps, or a long mile further on, by Gameshope
      Loch. A man might have lain long, in the summer time, amongst these rugged
      hills, safe hidden from any number of prying dragoons; but Heaven help him
      if he lay out there in the winter season. All is wild, broken country,
      peat-hags, mosses, and deep cleuchs, over which one goes best a-foot&mdash;and,
      of necessity, best with youth on one's side if the journey be of any great
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the height at the head of Donald's Cleuch burn, one looks down on
      that gloomy tarn, Loch Skene, lying but a few short miles on the Yarrow
      side of the watershed. Mr. Skene of Rubislaw tells&mdash;it is in
      Lockhart's life&mdash;how when Sir Walter Scott and he visited this loch,
      a thick fog came down over the hills, completely bewildering them, and "as
      we were groping through the maze of bogs, the ground gave way, and down
      went horse and horsemen pell-mell into a slough of peaty mud and black
      water, out of which, entangled as we were with our plaids and floundering
      nags, it was no easy matter to get extricated." Savage and desolate are
      perhaps the words that best describe Loch Skene; yet, in fine summer
      weather, how beautiful it may be! How beautiful, indeed, all this wild
      waste of hills where those dour old Covenanters were wont to lurk, never
      quite free from dread of the dragoons quartered but a few miles away over
      the hills at Moffat. Tales of the Covenanting times, such, for instance,
      as "The Brownie of Bodesbeck," used to possess an intense fascination for
      Scottish boys; every Covenanter was then an immaculate hero, and, I
      suppose, few boys took any but the worst view of Claverhouse, or refused
      credence to any of the countless legends of him. and of his diabolical
      black charger, of which we firmly believed the story that it could course
      a hare along the side of a precipice. A point in some of those tales that
      used to interest and puzzle at <span class="pagenum">370</span><a
      name="link370" id="link370"></a>least one boy, was the mysterious fashion
      in which a fugitive would at times disappear from ken when hard pressed on
      the open moor, and when apparently cut off from all chance of escape. A
      possible explanation presented itself to me one day, a summer or two back,
      when making my way across the bleak upland that lies between Gameshope
      Loch and Gameshope Burn. As I walked over the broken peaty surface of the
      plateau, but not yet arrived where the land begins to drop abruptly into
      the Gameshope Glen, a covey of grouse got up almost at my feet. The day
      was windless and very still, and as I stood watching the flight of the
      birds, the faint melodious tinkle of underground water somewhere very near
      to me fell on my ear. Glancing around, I saw on the flat ground in front
      of me within a yard of my feet, what appeared to be a hole, almost
      entirely concealed by heather. It was from this direction that the sound
      of the drip, drip of falling water seemed to come. Kneeling down, I pulled
      the heather aside, and found a hole two or three feet in diameter, and
      beneath it a roomy kind of chamber hollowed out of the peaty soil. It was
      a place perhaps five feet deep, big enough at a pinch to conceal half a
      dozen men; a place from which&mdash;unless there was a way out from below&mdash;a
      man might never find exit, if inadvertently he fell in and in his fall
      chanced to break a limb. In that wild region the prospect of his ever
      being discovered by searchers would be very small. Unseen of man, he might
      lie in that peaty grave till his bones bleached, rest in that lonely spot
      till the last dread trump called him forth to judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after I had chanced on this strange cavern, I returned with a
      friend to whom I wanted to show it, and though we knew that we must be
      often within a few yards of the spot, search as we might we never again
      found that hole. Was it in some <i>cache</i> such as this&mdash;perhaps in
      this very spot&mdash;that Covenanters sometimes lay hid? Here two or three
      might have lain for days or weeks at a time, sheltered from wind or rain
      and secure from hostile eyes; it would be warm enough, <span
      class="pagenum">371</span><a name="link371" id="link371"></a>and the drip
      of water into it is so slight as to be hardly worth naming. Doubtless if
      one took careful landmarks it would be easy to find again, once knowledge
      of its whereabouts was gained. And so the lurking Covenanters would have
      had small difficulty; but without such landmarks, to find it except by
      chance seems hopeless. None of the shepherds knew of the hole, save one
      old man who said he had heard there was some such place. But one might go
      a hundred times across that moor, passing close to the hidden mouth, and
      unless the faint tinkle of water betrayed it, or by remote chance one
      blundered in, its existence would never even be suspected. It is a place
      worthy to be the abode of the Brown Man of the Muirs; and the district is
      wild and lonesome enough to breed the most eerie of superstitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harking back now to the Tweed,&mdash;a little way above the bridge at
      Tweedsmuir on the right bank there is a huge standing stone, called the
      Giant's Stone, of which various legends are told. Two other stones lie
      close at hand, but these appear to be mere ordinary boulders. According to
      the Statistical Account of the Parish of 1833, this Giant's Stone is the
      sole survivor of a Druidical Circle; all its fellows were broken up for
      various purposes, and carted away; and we may be sure it was from no
      feeling of compunction that even the one was spared. Residents tell us
      that it was from behind this stone that a wily little archer in days of
      old sent an arrow into the heart of a giant on the far side of Tweed. The
      range is considerable; it must have been a glorious fluke. But I rather
      think the place that is credited with this event, and with the veritable
      grave of the slain giant, is higher up Tweed, opposite the Hawkshaw burn.
      Somewhere up this burn stood Hawkshaw Castle or Tower, home of that
      Porteous who gained unenviable notoriety for his feat of capturing at I
      alia Moss, with the aid of some of the moss-trooping fraternity, one of
      Cromwell's outposts, sixteen horse in all, and in cold blood afterwards
      executing the unfortunate troopers. A contemporary <span class="pagenum">372</span><a
      name="link372" id="link372"></a>historian relates that: "The greatest
      releiff at this tyme was by some gentillmen callit moss-trouperis, quha,
      haiffing quyetlie convenit in threttis and fourties, did cut off numberis
      of the Englishes, and seased on thair pockettis and horssis." The
      "pockettis and horssis" were all in the ordinary way of business; it is
      another affair when it comes to cutting the throats of defenceless
      captives.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few miles further on, the road we follow passes Badlieu, a place famed
      as the home, away back in the eleventh century, of Bonnie Bertha, who
      captured the roving heart of one of our early Scottish Kings as he hunted
      here one day in the forest. Unhappily for Bertha, there was already a
      Scottish Queen, and when news of the King's infatuation came to that
      lady's ears, she&mdash;queens have been known to entertain such prejudices&mdash;disapproved
      so strongly of the new <i>menage</i>, that one afternoon when the king
      (who had been absent on some warlike expedition) arrived at Bertha's
      bower, he found the nest harried, and Bertha and her month-old babe lying
      dead. And ever after, they say, to the end the King cared no more to hunt,
      nor took pride in war, but wandered disconsolate, mourning for this
      Scottish Fair Rosamond. But how the rightful Queen fared thereafter,
      tradition does not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we come to Tweed Shaws, and Tweed's Well, the latter by popular
      repute held to be the source of Tweed. But there is a tributary burn which
      runs a longer course than this, rising in the hills much nearer to the
      head-waters of Annan. As is well known,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Annan, Tweed, and Clyde
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Rise a' cot o' au hill-side,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      a statement which is sufficiently near the truth to pass muster. Near
      Tweed's Well of old stood Tweed's Cross, "so called," says Pennecuick,
      "from a cross which stood, and was erected there in time of Popery, as was
      ordinary in all the eminent places of public roads in the kingdom before
      our Reformation." It is needless to say that no trace of any cross now
      remains. <span class="pagenum">373</span><a name="link373" id="link373"></a>Up
      here, on this lofty, shelterless plateau, we find one of the few spots now
      left in Scotland where the old snow-posts still stand by the wayside, mute
      guides to the traveller when snow lies deep and the road is blotted from
      existence as effectually as is the track of a ship when she has passed
      across the ocean. Heaven's pity on those whom duty or necessity took
      across that wild moorland during a heavy snow storm in the old coaching
      days! Many a man perished up here, wandered from the track, bewildered;
      stopped to rest and to take his bearings, then slid gently into a sleep
      from which there was no wakening. In 1831, the mail-coach from Dumfries to
      Edinburgh left Moffat late one winter's afternoon. Snow was falling as for
      years it had not been known to fall, and as the day passed the drifts grew
      deeper and ever more deep. But the guard, MacGeorge, an old soldier, a man
      of few words, could not be induced to listen to those who spoke of danger
      and counselled caution. He had been "quarrelled" once before for being
      behind rime with the mail, said he; so long as he had power to go forward,
      never should "they" have occasion to quarrel him again. A matter of three
      or four miles up that heart-breaking, endless hill out of Moffat the coach
      toiled slowly, many times stopping to breathe the horses; and then it
      stuck fast. They took the horses out, loaded them with the mails, and
      guard and driver in company with a solitary passenger started again for
      Tweedshaws, leading the tired animals. Then the horses stuck, unable to
      face the deep drifts and the blinding storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      MacGeorge announced his intention of carrying the mailbags; they <i>must</i>
      be got through. The driver remonstrated. "Better gang back to Moffat," he
      said. "Gang ye, or bide ye, <i>I gang on!</i>" cried MacGeorge. So the
      horses were turned loose to shift for themselves, and the two men started
      on their hopeless undertaking, the passenger, on their advice, turning to
      make his way back to Moffat. That was the last ever seen alive of the two
      who went forward. Next <span class="pagenum">374</span><a name="link374"
      id="link374"></a>day, the mail-bags were found beyond the summit of the
      hill,&mdash;the most shelterless spot of the entire road,&mdash;hanging to
      a snow-post, fastened there by numbed hands that too apparently had been
      bleeding. But of guard and coachman no trace till three days later, when
      searchers found them, dead, on Mac-George's face "a kind o' a pleasure,"
      said the man who discovered the body in the deep snow. Some such fate as
      that ever trod here on the heels of foot passengers who wandered from the
      track during a snow-storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his "Strange Adventures of a Phæton," William Black writes of these
      hills as "a wilderness of heather and wet moss," even in the summer time;
      and he speaks of the "utter loneliness," the "profound and melancholy
      stillness." There is no denying that it is lonely, and often profoundly
      still. And no doubt to many there is monotony in the low, rolling,
      treeless, benty hills that here are the chief feature in the scenery. But
      I do not think it is melancholy. The sense of absolute freedom and of
      boundless space is too great to admit of melancholy creeping in. The
      feeling, to me at least, is more akin to that one experiences when
      standing on the deck of a full-rigged ship running down her Easting in
      "the Roaring Forties," with the wind drumming hard out of the Sou'West.
      From the haze, angry grey seas come raging on the weather quarter,
      snarling as they curl over and leap to fling themselves aboard, then,
      baffled, spew up in seething turmoil from beneath the racing keel, and
      hurry off to leeward. There you have a plethora of monotony; each hurrying
      sea is exactly the mate of his fellow that went before him, twin of that
      which follows after. Day succeeds day without other variety than what may
      come from the carrying of less or more sail; hour after hour, day after
      day, the same gigantic albatrosses, with far-stretched motionless wings
      soar and wheel leisurely over and around the ship, never hasting, never
      stopping,&mdash;unhasting and relentless as Death himself. Monotony
      absolute and supreme, but a sense of freedom and of boundless space, and
      no touch of <span class="pagenum">375</span><a name="link375" id="link375"></a>melancholy.
      So it is here among these rolling hills where the infant Tweed is born.
      There is no melancholy in the situation, or at worst it can be but of
      brief duration. Who could feel melancholy when, at last on the extreme
      summit and beginning the long descent towards Moffat, he sees spread out
      on either hand that glorious crescent of hills, rich in the purple bloom
      of heather; Annan deep beneath his feet wandering far through her quiet
      valley, and dim in the distance, the English hills asleep in the golden
      haze of afternoon. For my part, I would fain linger, perched up here, late
      into the summer gloaming, watching the panorama change with the changing
      light when the sun has long set and the glow is dying m the west;
    </p>

    <p class="indent15">

      <br />

    <p>
      And this ground is classic ground. It was at Errickstane, not far below,
      where, more than six hundred years ago, the young Sir James Douglas found
      Bruce riding on his way to Scone, to be crowned King of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to the left of the road shortly after leaving its highest point on the
      hill, there yawns that tremendous hollow, the Devil's Beef Tub, or, as it
      is sometimes called, the Marquis of Annandale's Beef Stand. It was here in
      the '45 that a Highland prisoner, suddenly wrapping himself tight in his
      plaid, threw himself over the edge ana rolled like a hedgehog to the
      bottom, escaping, sore bruised indeed, but untouched by the bullets that
      were sent thudding and whining after him by the outwitted prisoners'
      guard. He is a desperate man who would attempt a like feat, even minus the
      chance of a bullet. It is a wild place and a terrible. The reason of its
      being called the Marquis's Beef Stand is given by Summertrees in
      "Redgauntlet." It was, said he, "because the Annandale loons used to put
      their stolen cattle in there." And Summer-tree's description of it is so
      truthful and vivid that it behoves one to quote it in full: "It looks as
      if four hills were laying <span class="pagenum">376</span><a name="link376"
      id="link376"></a>their heads together to shut out daylight from the dark
      hollow space between them.

      and goes straight down from the road-side, as perpendicular as it can do,
      to be a heathery brae. At the bottom there is a small bit of a brook, that

    <p>
      And so, finally, having overshot the limits of Tweed and her tributaries,
      we cast back to the hills on the immediate border-line of the two
      kingdoms, and pass into the country of Dandie Dinmont.

      CHAPTER XVI LIDDESDALE, HERMITAGE, CASTLETON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>oming<span
      class="pagenum">378</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a> into
      Liddesdale by the route followed by Prince Charlie, over the hills by Note
      o' the Gate, one finds, a few miles past that curiously-named spot and no
      great distance from the road, the scene of a momentous battle of ancient
      times. It is claimed that it was here on Dawstane Rig the mighty struggle
      took place in the year 603 between Edelfrid, King of the Northumbrians,
      and Aidan, King of the Scots, the result of which, says Bede, writing a
      century and a quarter later, was that "from that time no king of the Scots
      durst come into Britain to make war on the Angles to this day." As written
      by Bede, the name of the place where the battle was fought is Uaegsastan,&mdash;a
      "famous place," he calls it. Dalston, near Carlisle, also claims the
      honour of being the true site of this great defeat of the Scots; But
      Dawstane Rig seems the more probable spot, for, judging from the number of
      camps in the immediate vicinity, it must assuredly in old days have
      answered the description of a "famous place." There are numerous signs,
      also, that a great fight did at some remote period take place here; traces
      of escarpments are numerous on the hill side, arrowheads and other
      suggestive implements have frequently been picked up, and over all the
      hill are low cairns or mounds of stones, probably burial places of the
      slain. So far as I am aware, no excavations have ever been made here, the
      dead&mdash;<span class="pagenum">379</span><a name="link379" id="link379"></a>if
      these stones do indeed cover the dead&mdash;sleep undisturbed where they
      fell. But if the work were judiciously done, it would be interesting and
      instructive to make a systematic search over the reputed battle ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far distant from this ancient field of battle, but a little closer to
      the base of Peel Fell, runs a Roman road, the old Wheel Causeway, and
      into, or almost into, this road comes the Catrail, here finally
      disappearing. I have never heard any suggestion made of a reason why this
      Picts' Work Dyke should stop abruptly in, or at least on the very verge
      of, a Roman high-way. It is difficult to accept the theory that the
      Catrail was a road, because, in places where it crosses streams, no
      attempt is made to diverge towards a ford, or even to an easy entrance to
      the river bed; it plunges in where the bank is often most inconveniently
      precipitous, and emerges again where it is equally steep. Yet if it was
      not a road, why should it run into and end in a recognised road that must
      have been in existence when the Catrail was formed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the Wheel Causeway, a little distance beyond the spot where the Catrail
      disappears, and between the Wormscleuch and Peel burns, there stood at one
      time an ancient ecclesiastical building, the Wheel Chapel, of whose walls
      faint traces still remain. It was in this building that Edward I of
      England passed the night of 24th May 1296, during his Bolder Progress; in
      the record of his expedition the chapel is spoken of as the "Wyel." When
      the Statistical Account of 1798 was written, probably a considerable part
      of the ruin yet stood, for the writer of that account speaks of it as
      being of "excellent workmanship," and "pretty large." And he remarks on
      the great number of grave-stones in the churchyard, from which he con
      eludes that the surrounding population must at one rime have been very
      considerable. Over all this district, indeed, that seems to have been the
      case. Chapels were numerous among these hills; in this part of Liddesdale
      there were no fewer than five, and the Wheel Chapel itself is not more
      than six miles or <span class="pagenum">380</span><a name="link380"
      id="link380"></a>so, as the crow flies, from Southdean, where it is
      certain that about the date of the battle of Otterburne the population was
      much more dense than it is at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      What changes little more than one hundred years have wrought in this
      countryside. Six years before the Statistical Account of 1798 was penned,
      there were neither roads nor bridges in Liddesdale; "through these deep
      and broken bogs and mosses we must <i>crawl</i>, to the great fatigue of
      ourselves but the much greater injury of our horses," pathetically says
      the reverend writer of the account. Every article of merchandise had to be
      carried on horseback. Sir Walter Scott himself&mdash;in August 1800&mdash;was
      the first who ever drove a wheeled vehicle among the Liddesdale hills, and
      we know from "Guy Mannering," and from Lockhart's "Life," pretty well what
      a wild country it then was. There was not an inn or a public house in the
      whole valley, says Lockhart; "the travellers passed from the shepherd's
      hut to the minister's manse, and again from the cheerful hospitality of
      the manse to the rough and jolly welcome of the homestead." Inns, to be
      sure, even now are not to be found, and are not needed, by every roadside,
      but at least there are excellent main roads down both Liddel and
      Hermitage, and a main line of railway runs through the valley; the moors
      are well drained, and the necessity no longer exists to "crawl" through
      broken bogs and mosses. Yet still the hills in appearance are as they were
      in Scott's day, still they retain features which render them distinct from
      any other of the Border hills; they are "greener and more abrupt....
      sinking their sides at once upon the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They had no pretensions to magnificence of height, or to romantic shapes,
      nor did their smooth swelling slopes exhibit either rocks or woods. Yet
      the view was wild, solitary, and pleasingly rural. No enclosures, no
      roads, almost no tillage,&mdash;it seemed a land which a patriarch would
      have chosen to feed his flocks and herds. The remains of here and there a
      dismantled and ruined tower showed that it had once harboured beings of a
      very different description <span class="pagenum">381</span><a
      name="link381" id="link381"></a>from its present inhabitants,&mdash;those
      freebooters, namely, to whose exploits the wars between England and
      Scotland bear witness." The description might almost have been written
      today. The wild, hard riding, hard living freebooter of Johnie Armstrong's
      day is gone, leaving but a name and a tradition, or at most the mouldering
      walls of some old peel tower. But Dandie Dinmont himself, I think may
      still be found here in the flesh, as true a friend, as generous, as brave
      and steadfast as ever was his prototype,&mdash;but no longer as hard
      drinking. The days of "run" brandy from the Solway Firth are over, and the
      scene mentioned by Lockhart is now impossible, where Scott's host, a
      Liddesdale farmer, on a slight noise being heard outside, the evening of
      the traveller's arrival, <i>banged</i> up from his knees during family
      prayers, shouting "By&mdash;&mdash;, here's the keg at last!"
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the previous day of Scott's proposed visit, he had sent off two
      men to some smuggler's haunt to obtain a supply of liquor, that his
      reputation for hospitality might not be shamed. And here it was, to the
      great prejudice of that evening's family worship! I do not suppose that
      the present day "Dandie" leisters fish any longer,&mdash;though one would
      not take on oneself rashly to swear that such a thing is even now entirely
      impossible, but certainly within recent years fox hunts have taken place
      amongst these hills much after the fashion described in "Guy Mannering."
      In such a country, indeed, what other means can there he of dealing with
      the hill foxes?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another road into Liddesdale from the north, that which comes
      from Hawick up the Slitrig, past Stohs camp, then through the gap in the
      hills by Shankend and over the watershed by Limekilnedge, where
      Whitterhope Burn&mdash;tributary of Hermitage Water&mdash;takes its rise.
      As you drop down to heights less elevated, you pass on your left the Nine
      Stane Rig, a Druidical Circle, but locally more famed as the spot where
      the cruel and detestable Sorcerer, Lord Soulis, came to his grisly end.
      "Oh, <i>BOIL</i> him, if you like, but let me be plagued no more," cried
      (according to tradition) a Scottish <span class="pagenum">382</span><a
      name="link382" id="link382"></a>Monarch, wearied by the importunities of
      those who endlessly brought before him their grievances against the wicked
      lord. So&mdash;as Leyden wrote&mdash;

      ("Spreat" is a species of rush, and "deer-hair" a coarse kind of grass.)
      Not the least painful part of the operation one would think must have been
      the getting so large a body into so small a cauldron. Some necromancy
      stronger than his own must have been employed to get him into a pot of the
      dimensions of that long preserved at Skelf-hill and shown to the curious
      as the identical cauldron. Of the stones that still remain of the original
      nine, two used to be pointed out as those between which the muckle pot was
      suspended on an iron bar, gipsy-kettle fashion. In reality, I believe this
      last of the de Soulis family died in Dumbarton Castle, a prisoner accused
      of conspiracy and treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little way up Hermitage Water from the junction of Whitterhope Burn,
      stands the massive and most striking ruin of Hermitage Castle. Externally,
      the walls of this formidable stronghold are said to be mostly of the
      fifteenth century, but in part, of course, the building is very much
      older. The first castle built here is said to have been erected by
      Nicholas de Soulis in the beginning of the thirteenth century, and on a
      map of about the year 1300 Hermitage is shown as one of the <span
      class="pagenum">383</span><a name="link383" id="link383"></a>great
      frontier fortresses. There were, however, earlier proprietors of these
      lands than the de Soulis's, who may, presumably, have lived here in some
      stronghold of their own, to which their successors may have added. About
      the year 1180, Walter de Bolbeck granted "to God and Saint Mary and
      Brother William of Mercheley" the hermitage in his "waste" called
      Mercheley, beside Hermitage Water&mdash;then called the Merching burn. But
      from a much earlier date than this, possibly as early as the sixth
      century, the place had been famed as the retreat of a succession of holy
      men, and probably something in the nature of a chapel existed even then.
      The chapel whose remains still stand, close by the bank of the tumbling
      stream, a few hundred yards higher up than the castle, is, I understand,
      of thirteenth century origin. It measures a little over fifty-one feet in
      length and twenty-four in width, and the ruins are of much interest, if it
      were only for the thought of those who in their day must have heard mass
      within its walls, and perhaps there confessed their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      And surely, if sinners ever required absolution, some of those who must
      have knelt here had need to ask it. On the shoulders of de Soulis and Both
      well alone&mdash;among those who from time to lime held the castle of
      Hermitage perhaps the chief of sinners,&mdash;there rested a load of
      iniquity too heavy to be borne by ordinary mortal; and of the others, some
      perhaps did not lag far behind in cruelty and wickedness. If the tale be
      all true regarding the last days of Sir Alexander Ramsay in 1342, the
      Knight of Liddesdale had a good deal to answer for during his tenancy of
      the castle. The interior of the building is in so much more ruinous a
      state than the outside, that it is not possible to follow with any degree
      of accuracy incidents that took place within its walls. It is said that
      before death ended his pangs, Sir Alexander Ramsay eked out a miserable
      existence for seventeen days on grains of corn that dribbled down from a
      granary overhead into the dungeon where he lay. But the small dungeon
      where he is <span class="pagenum">384</span><a name="link384" id="link384"></a>said
      to have been confined has a vaulted roof, and the room above was
      manifestly a guard room; so that&mdash;unless there was some other dungeon&mdash;probably
      this story too, so far at least as the grains of corn are concerned, must
      go the way of other picturesque old tales.

    <p>
      Some interesting relics were found among the rubbish on the floor when the
      dungeon was opened early in the nineteenth century, but I do not know that
      there was anything that could in any way be connected with Sir Alexander's
      fate. Many an unhappy wretch no doubt had occupied the place since his
      day. But what there was I believe was given to Sir Walter Scott, who also,
      as readers may see in Lockhart's "Life," got from Dr. Elliot of Cleuchhead
      "the large old Border war horn, which ye may still see hanging in the
      armoury at Abbotsford.... One of the doctor's servants had used it many a
      day as a grease-horn for his scythe, <span class="pagenum">385</span><a
      name="link385" id="link385"></a>before they discovered its history. When
      cleaned out, it was never a hair the worse&mdash;the original chain, hoop,
      and mouthpiece of steel, were all entire, just as you now see them. Sir
      Walter carried it home all the way from Liddesdale to Jedburgh, slung
      about his neck like Johnny Gilpin's bottle, while I [Shortreed] was
      intrusted with an ancient bridle-bit which we had likewise picked up." The
      horn I think had been found in a marshy bit of land near the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since about 1594, Hermitage has been the property of the Scotts of
      Buccleuch, into whose hands it came through their connection with Francis
      Stewart, Earl of Bothwell. A sketch done in 1810 shows that at that date
      one wall of the castle was rent from top to bottom by an enormous fissure,
      seemingly almost beyond redemption. But about 1821, careful repairs were
      undertaken by order of the then Duke of Buccleuch, and, externally, the
      building now seems to be in excellent condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a warrior, no doubt, lies buried in the graveyard of Hermitage
      chapel, but I do not think any tombstones of very-great age have ever been
      found. Outside, however, between the wall of the burial ground and the
      river, there is an interest ing mound, the reputed grave of the famous
      Cout o' Keilder. Keilder is a district of Northumberland adjoining Peel
      Fell, and in the day of the wizard Soulis, that iniquitous lord's most
      noted adversary was the chief of Keilder, locally called, from his great
      size and strength and activity, "the Cout." In his last desperate fight
      with Soulis and his followers on the banks of Hermitage Water, the Cout
      was hewing a bloody path through the press of men, towards his chief
      enemy, when weight of numbers forced him, like a wounded stag, to take to
      the water. Here, at bay in the rushing stream, guarding himself from the
      foes who swarmed on either bank, the Cout stumbled and fell, and, hampered
      by his armour, he could not regain his feet; for each time that the
      drowning man got his head above water, Soulis and his band thrust him back
      with their long spears. Finally, as he became more exhausted, they held
      him down. And so the Cout perished. Here on the grassy bank,<span
      class="pagenum">386</span><a name="link386" id="link386"></a> hard by what
      is still called "The Cout o' Keilder's pool," is his grave.

      But one is disappointed to learn that when an examination of it was made
      some years ago, no gigantic bones were unearthed, nor indeed any bones at
      all.

    <p>
      There is in some of the hills near Hermitage a peculiarity which cannot
      fail to strike observers; and that is, the deep gashes&mdash;you cannot
      call them glens&mdash;that have been cut here and there by the small
      burns. Scored wide and deep into the smooth sides of the hills, they are
      yet not so wide as to force themselves on the eye. It would be possible to
      drive into them, and there effectually to conceal for a time, large mobs
      of cattle, and I do not doubt that in old days these fissures were often
      so used when a hostile English force was moving up the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one goes down Hermitage Water towards its junction with the Liddel, the
      country, one finds, is plentifully sprinkled <span class="pagenum">387</span><a
      name="link387" id="link387"></a>with the ruins of peel towers,&mdash;abandoned
      rookeries of the Elliot clan, I suppose, for the Armstrong holdings were a
      little lower down. But in old days, when the de Soulis's held all
      Liddesdale, there were other strong castles besides Hermitage. Near
      Dinlabyre there stood the castle of Clintwood, and not far from the
      meeting of the two streams, on the high bank of Liddel, stood one of their
      strongholds&mdash;Liddel Castle. It was from this castle that the old
      village of Castleton look its name: the village was at first merely a
      settlement of de Soulis's followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Statistical Account of the Parish gives an extract from the
      Session Records of Castleton church which is of interest. It is as
      follows: "17 January 1649. The English army commanded by Colonels Bright
      and Pride, and under the conduct of General Cromwell, on their return to
      England, did lie at the Kirk of Castleton several nights, in which time
      they brak down and burnt the Communion table and the seats of the Kirk;
      and at their removing carried away the minister's books, to the value of
      one thousand merks and above, and also the books of Session, with which
      they lighted their tobacco pipes, the baptism, marriage, and examination
      rolls from October 1612 to September 1648, all which were lost and
      destroyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Castleton as a village does not now exist, and the old church has
      disappeared, though the churchyard is still used. The other village, the
      present Newcastleton, is of course entirely a township of yesterday&mdash;-to
      be precise, it dates only from 1793. But it is interesting from the fact
      that the present railway station occupies the site where once stood the
      tower of Park, the peel of that "Little Jock Elliot" who so nearly put an
      end to the life of Bothwell. What a difference it might have made if he
      had but stabbed in a more vital spot, or a little deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from Castleton was the home of the notorious Willie of
      Westburnflat, last of the old reivers, and&mdash;it almost goes <span
      class="pagenum">388</span><a name="link388" id="link388"></a>without
      saying&mdash;an Armstrong; the last of those of whom it was written:

    <p class="indent20">
      "Of Liddisdail the common thiefis,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But Willie lived in degenerate days; the times were out of joint, and
      reiving as a profession had gone out of fashion. People now resented
      having their eye "lifted," and meanly invoked the new-fangled aid of the
      Law in redressing such grievances. Nevertheless, Willie did his best to
      maintain old customs, and consequently he was feared and hated far beyond
      the bounds of Liddesdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern prejudice however at length became too strong for him. It so fell
      out that a dozen or so of cows, raided one night from Teviotdale, were
      traced to Westburnflat. In the dead of night, when Willie was peacefully
      asleep, tired perhaps, and soothed by the consciousness of a deed well
      done, the men of Teviotdale arrived, and, bursting in, before Willie could
      gather his scattered wits or realise what was happening he was overpowered
      by numbers, and they had bound him fast, hand and foot. His trial, along
      with that of nine friends and neighbours, was held at Selkirk, and though
      the lost cattle had not been found in his possession, and the evidence of
      this particular theft was in no way conclusive, on the question of general
      character alone the jury thought it safer to find all the prisoners
      guilty. Sentence of death was pronounced. Thereupon Willie arose in wrath,
      seized the heavy oak chair on which he had been seated, broke it in pieces
      by main strength, kept a strong leg for himself, and passing the remainder
      to his condemned comrades, called to them to stand by him and they would
      fight their way out of Selkirk. There is little doubt, too, that he would
      have succeeded had he been properly backed up. But his friends&mdash;<span
      class="pagenum">389</span><a name="link389" id="link389"></a>poor
      "fushiunless," spiritless creatures, degenerate Armstrongs surely, if they
      were Armstrongs&mdash;seized his hands and cried to him to "<i>let them
      die like Christians</i>."

      Perhaps it was a kind of equivalent to turning King's Evidence; they may
      have hoped to curry favour and to be treated leniently because of their

      Nothing now is left of the building, but Sir Walter mentions that an old
      carved stone from its walls is built into a neighbouring mill. Near to
      Mangerton, in a field between Newcastleton and Ettletown Churchyard, is
      the interesting Milnholm Cross, said to have been erected somewhere about
      six hundred years ago to mark the spot where a dead chief of the
      Armstrongs lay, prior to being buried at Ettletown. The tradition as given
      in the Statistical Account of 1798, is as follows: "One of the governors
      of Hermitage Castle, some say Lord Soulis, others Lord Douglas, having
      entertained a passion for a young woman in the lower part of the parish,
      went to her house, and was met by her father, who, wishing to conceal his
      daughter, was instantly killed by the Governor. He was soon pursued by the
      people, and, in extreme danger, took refuge with Armstrong of Mangerton,
      who had influence enough to prevail on the <span class="pagenum">391</span><a
      name="link391" id="link391"></a>people to desist from the pursuit, and by
      this means saved his life. Seemingly with a view to make a return for this
      favour, but secretly jealous of the power and influence of Armstrong, he
      invited him to Hermitage, where he was basely murdered. He himself, in his
      turn, was killed by Jock of the Side, of famous memory, and brother to
      Armstrong. The cross was erected in memory of the transaction." Here, too,
      I fear tradition is untrustworthy. Jock of the Syde&mdash;"a greater thief
      did never ride"&mdash;lived long after the day of the de Soulis's or of
      Douglas; he was, indeed, contemporary with the equally notorious "Johne of
      the Parke,"&mdash;Little Jock Elliot. This Milnholm Cross is a little over
      eight feet in height. The carving is worn, and not very distinct, but on a
      shield there is the heraldic device of the Armstrongs, a bent arm; some
      lettering, i.h.s.; below, the initials m.a., and what appears to be a.a.;
      and on the shaft is cut a two-handed sword, about four feet in length. In
      his "History of Liddesdale," (1883). Bruce Armstrong says the shield was
      added "recently."

      CHAPTER XVII KERSHOPEFOOT, CARLISLE CASTLE, SOLWAY MOSS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> little<span
      class="pagenum">392</span><a name="link392" id="link392"></a> further down
      the river we come to the Kershope Burn, here the boundary between Scotland
      and England. It was here, at "the Dayholme of Kershoup"&mdash;which I take
      to be the flat land on the Scottish side of Liddel, opposite to the mouth
      of the burn&mdash;that the Wardens' Meeting was held in 1596, which became
      afterwards so famous owing to the illegal capture by the English of
      Kinmont Willie. All the world knows the tale, and all the world knows how
      gallantly Buccleuch rescued the prisoner from Carlisle Castle. But until
      one goes to Carlisle, and takes note for oneself of the difficulties with
      which Buccleuch had to contend, and the apparently hopeless nature of his
      undertaking, it is not possible to appreciate the full measure of the
      rescuer's gallantry. Kinmont, I suppose, on the day of his capture was
      riding quietly homeward down the Scottish side of the river, suspecting no
      evil, for the day was a day of truce. "Upon paine of death, presentlie to
      be executed, all persones whatsoever that come to these meitings sould be
      saife fra any proceiding or present occasioun, from the tyme of Meiting of
      the Wardens, or their Deputies, till the next Day at the sun rysing." The
      English did not play the game; from their own side of Liddel they had
      probably kept Kinmont in sight, meaning to seize him if opportunity
      offered. And they made the opportunity. For the most part, the banks of
      <span class="pagenum">393</span><a name="link393" id="link393"></a>Liddel
      here are steep and broken, and the river is devoid of any ford; but a mile
      or two down from Kershopefoot the land on the Scottish side slopes gently
      from the water, and it is easily fordable.

      Here probably began the chase which ended in Willie's capture. A very fine
      sword was found near this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of Kinmont's release, the 13th of April, 1596, was very dark,
      with rain falling, and a slight mist rising over the river flats at
      Carlisle. And the Eden was swollen. It is not possible to form any very
      definite idea of the initial difficulty Buccleuch must have met with at
      this point, because the bed of the river is now entirely different from
      what it was then. In former days, I believe, a long, low island lay in
      mid-stream, the water flowing swiftly through two channels. Even now there
      is shallow water part way across, but the stream runs strong and <span
      class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394" id="link394"></a>it would be
      ill to ford, especially on a dark night. Buccleuch, I take it, must have
      swum his horses across the Eden nearly opposite, but a trifle above, the
      mouth of the litde river Caldew, the water being at the tyme, through
      raines that had fallen, weill thick; he comes to the Sacray, a plaine
      place under the toune and castell, and halts upon the syde of a little
      water or burn that they call "Caday."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      The "Sacray" is of course what now goes by the name of the Sauceries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buccleuch's scaling ladders proved too short to enable him to get within
      the castle walls by their means; but there is a small postern gate in the
      wall (nearly abreast of the present public Abattoirs), and this was
      forced, or at least one or two men squeezed in here, possibly by removing
      a stone below the gate, and opened the postern to their comrades. This
      postern has recently been reopened. After Buccleuch's exploit it had been
      securely built upon both sides, outside and in; and later, <span
      class="pagenum">395</span><a name="link395" id="link395"></a>a Cook's
      galley and other domestic offices were erected on the inner side, against
      the wall, effectually hiding the old gate.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0415.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      These buildings and the stonework blocking the postern have now been
      pulled down, and the identical little oaken gate through which Buccleuch
      and his men entered, once more has seen the light of day, and, I
      understand, is now being put in a state of thorough repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made his entry, Buccleuch placed one part of his force between the
      castle and the town, so that he might not be assailed in rear, and,
      leaving a few men to guard the postern and secure their retreat, the rest
      pushed towards Kinmont Willie's place of confinement in the Keep, all
      making as great a noise as possible, "to terrifie both castell and toune
      by ane imaginatioun of a greater force." Hitherto they had encountered
      only the castle sentinels, who were easily scattered and brushed aside;
      "the rest that was within doors heiring the noyse of the trumpet within,
      and that the castell was entered, and the noyse of others without, both
      the Lord <span class="pagenum">396</span><a name="link396" id="link396"></a>Scroope

      It was one thing, however, for the rescuers to have forced their way
      inside the castle walls, but it should have been quite another, to
      accomplish the feat of getting the prisoner out of the dungeon. Through a
      female spy they knew in what part of the castle he lay; but his place of
      confinement,&mdash;inside the Keep,&mdash;was quite a hundred yards from
      the postern gate, and <span class="pagenum">397</span><a name="link397"
      id="link397"></a>surely a few resolute men might have held so strong a
      post for a time without much difficulty. Lord Scrope, however, did not
      emerge from his retreat; and to the others as well, discretion seemed the
      better part of valour.

      Meantime, Buccleuch's trumpets were blaring out the arrogant old Elliot
      slogan; "<i>O wha daur meddle wi' me?</i>"; and his men, falling to with
      energy, forced the gate of the Keep, burst in the massive door of the
      outer dungeon, tore away that of the dark and noisome inner prison, a
      rough, vaulted stone chamber to which no ray of light ever penetrated even
      on the brightest clay, and there they found Kinmont, chained to the wall.

      cried he, according to the ballad. Was he, one cannot help wondering,
      ashamed of the English breach of Border law entailed in the matter of
      Kinmont's capture, and was he in a measure wilfully playing into
      Buccleuch's hands? If that were the case, he took on himself a heavy risk.
      Elizabeth was not exactly the kind of Sovereign who would be likely to be

      Not far from Longtown, at a place called Dick's Tree, on the farther side
      of Esk, there still stands the "smiddy" (or smith's shop) where Kinmont's
      irons were struck off. In one of Sir Walter Scott's M.S. letters of 1826
      it is told that: "Tradition preserves the account of the smith's daughter,
      then a child, how there was a <i>sair clatter</i> at the door about
      daybreak, and loud crying for the smith; but her father not being on the
      alert, Buccleueh himself thrust his lance thro' the window, which
      effectually bestirred him. On looking out, the woman continued, she saw,
      in the grey of the morning, more gentlemen than she had ever before seen
      in one place, all on horseback, in armour, and dripping wet&mdash;and that
      Kinmont Willie, who sat woman fashion behind one of them, was the biggest
      carle she ever saw&mdash;and there was much merriment in <span
      class="pagenum">400</span><a name="link400" id="link400"></a>the company."
      Except for this event, Dick's Tree is quite uninteresting, and quite
      unpicturesque; it is merely a cottage like a thousand others to be seen in
      the Border, possessing no special feature, or even any indication of
      antiquity.

      And no one works the "smiddy" now, except at odd times; modern
      requirements have, I understand, taken the business away to Longtown.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the end of Kinmont Willie no one knows, but he <span
      class="pagenum">401</span><a name="link401" id="link401"></a>certainly
      lived to pay, to some small extent, for his "lodging maill;" he was
      engaged in a raid on Lord Scrope's tenants in the year 1600, and doubtless
      he did not forget the debt incurred at Carlisle. Later than this I think
      there is no record of him, but it would not be surprising to learn that at
      the last Lord Scrope was able to give a receipt in full. Many an Armstrong
      in old days danced at the end of a rope at "Hairribie." Not improbably,
      Kinmont was one of them. There is a grave in an old churchyard not far
      from the Tower of Sark, which is pointed out as his. But the date on the
      tombstone makes it impossible that the veritable Willie of Kinmont lies
      underneath. The name of "William Armstrong called Kynmount" is in Lord
      Maxwell's Muster Roll of 1585, together with those of his seven sons.
      Willie, therefore&mdash;if at that date he had seven sons fit to fight&mdash;could
      have been no youth. Now the William Armstrong to whose memory the Sark
      tombstone is erected died in 1658, which, if he had been the famous
      Kinmont, would give him an age of considerably over a hundred years. But
      in any case, it is an interesting old stone. Many years ago steps were
      taken to preserve it from further decay, and the lettering and other
      points were retouched. Round the edges of the stone is cut:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>HEIR LYES. ANE. WORTHIE. PERSON. CALLIT. WILLIAM. ARMSTRONG. OF. SARK.
      WHO. DIED. TE IO. DAY. OF. JUNE. 16. 58. AETATIS. SVAE. 56</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the body of the stone:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Man as grass to grave he flies.

      Below are the Armstrong bent arm holding a sword, a skull and crossed
      bones, an hour glass and other emblems, and below all, "memento mora."
      This William Armstrong, therefore, who died in 1658, aged 56, was not born
      when Kinmont Willie was rescued by Buccleuch from Carlisle Castle.

      Down the river is Sark Bridge, with its toll-bar, and adjacent to it,
      Gretna Green. At the tollhouse alone in the early part of last century,
      within six years thirteen hundred couples were married&mdash;a profitable
      business for the "priest," (usually the village blacksmith,) for his fee
      ranged from half a guinea to a hundred pounds, according to the
      circumstances of each fond couple. But what was charged in a case such as
      that of Lord Erskine, Lord High Chancellor of England, who, when he was
      nearly seventy years of age, eloped with a blushing spinster and was
      married at Gretna&mdash;in the Inn, I think&mdash;history does not tell.

      surely not without its own beauty under certain combinations of sun and
      cloud. "Solway Moss" is a name of evil repute to us of Scotland, for here
      on 24th <span class="pagenum">404</span><a name="link404" id="link404"></a>November
      1542 took place the most miserable of all Border battles&mdash;if indeed

      The encounter, such as it was, took place not so much in Solway Moss,
      however, as over towards Arthuret. The Scots&mdash;a strong raiding army,
      but disorganised, and in a state of incipient mutiny against their
      newly-appointed leader, Oliver Sinclair, (Ridpath says: "a general murmur
      and breach of all order immediately ensued" when his appointment was made
      known,)&mdash;at dawn of the 24th were already burning northward through
      the Debateable Land. Wharton with his compact little English force watched
      them from Arthuret Howes and skilfully drew them into a hopeless trap
      between the Esk and an impassable swamp, where there was no room to
      deploy. Here the English&mdash;at most not a sixth part so numerous as the
      Scots&mdash;charging down on the Scottish right flank threw them into
      hopeless confusion, and from that minute all was over. <span
      class="pagenum">405</span><a name="link405" id="link405"></a>Panic seized
      the Scots: men cast aside whatever might hamper their flight, and,
      plunging into the water, scrambled for what safety they might find among
      the Grahams and the English borderers of Liddesdale&mdash;which, as it
      turned out, meant little better than scrambling from the frying pan into
      the fire.

      Many were driven into the swamp and perished there miserably, many were
      drowned in the river, and twelve hundred men&mdash;including a large
      percentage of nobles&mdash;were captured. Out of a force variously
      estimated at from two to three thousand strong&mdash;Sir William Musgrave,
      who was with the cavalry, puts it at the higher figure&mdash;the English
      lost but seven men killed. It was a <span class="pagenum">406</span><a

      I do not know if Arthuret church was injured on this occasion; it is
      recorded in 1597 that it had then been ruinous for about sixty years.
      Perhaps the Armstrongs may have been responsible; they made a big raid
      hereaway in 1528. The present building dates, I believe, from 1609.

      There was another calamity connected with Solway Moss, later than the
      battle and local in effect, yet sufficiently terrible to cast over the
      district a black shadow of tragedy, the memory of which time has lightened
      but even yet has not entirely wiped out. November 1771 was a month of evil
      note for its storms and ceaseless wet. Day followed day sodden with
      driving rain, and the country lay smothered under a ragged grey blanket of
      mist. Firm ground became a quagmire that quaked under foot, pools widened
      into lakes, and the rivers <span class="pagenum">407</span><a

      Liddel roared through the rocky gorge of Fenton Linn with a fury such as

      living in the low lying flats surrounding the Moss, alarmed for the safety
      of their cattle, were abroad in the dark of the morning of 16th November,
      intent on getting the beasts to higher ground, <span class="pagenum">408</span><a

      The Moss had burst, spewing out from its maw a putrid mass that spread
      relentlessly, engulfing house after house, in many cases catching the
      inhabitants in their beds. For weeks the horrible eruption spread, and ere
      its advance was stayed thirty families were homeless, their houses,
      furniture, and live-stock buried twenty feet deep under a black slime that
      stank like the pit of Tophet.

      Harking back to Carlisle, (which we left in company of Kinmont Willie,)
      one would fain linger in that pleasant town, to dream awhile over its
      alluring past. But Carlisle is a subject too big to introduce at the close
      of a volume; there is a more than sufficient material in the story of the
      castle (with its wealth of warlike and other memories), and of the
      Cathedral, alone to make a fair-sized book. There is too much to tell;
      for, besides the story of the captivity here of Queen Mary of <span
      class="pagenum">409</span><a name="link409" id="link409"></a>Scotland, and
      that of the capture of Carlisle by Prince Charlie, there are a hundred and
      one other things, if once a beginning were made and space to tell them
      were available. (What used to be called Queen Mary's Tower, to save cost
      of repairs was pulled down by Government between 1824 and 1835, together
      with the Hall in which Edward I held Parliaments, and much else of
      surpassing interest. Vandalism in those days was a vice which affected not
      alone the private individual.) Moreover, there would be the question of
      where to stop, for if the history of Carlisle be touched upon, at once we
      are mixed up with that of half a score of places in the immediate
      neighbourhood, all of which are full of profoundest interest. There would
      be, for example, Naworth, not far from the quaint little town of Brampton,
      Naworth with its massive walls, and memories of the Dacres, and of Belted
      Will Howard&mdash;a name better known to Border fame, at least to the
      Borderer of to day, than even that of his predecessors. Then there would
      necessarily be the fascinating subject of the Roman wall, of Bird-Oswald
      camp, of Lanercost, and of Gilsland, with its memories of Sir Walter. One
      must needs make an end somewhere, and it is hopeless to treat of such
      subjects in small space. But Bewcastle, perhaps, because of its connection
      with a subject mentioned earlier in this volume, must not be omitted.

      But if a secular antiquary and a ballad lover, you fill the landscape with
      galloping reivers, you restore the royal flag of England to the tower, and
      your mind is full of the rough riding life of Mus-graves and Grahams,
      Scotts, Elliots and Armstrongs. If, on the other hand, your tastes are
      ecclesiastical, and you are an amateur of Runic writing, you can pass
      hours with the tall headless Runic cross beside the church, a work of art

      Bewcastle is at least ten miles from the nearest railway at Penton; twelve
      from Brampton; not easily approached by a fell path from Gilsland; and is
      most easily if least romantically reached by motor car from Carlisle, a
      drive of nearly twenty <span class="pagenum">413</span><a name="link413"
      id="link413"></a>miles. The Elliots and Scotts of the reiving days, got at
      Bewcastle by riding down Liddel water, crossing it at the Kershope burn
      ford, and then robbing all and sundry through some four miles. The castle
      they could not take in a casual expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oldest monument in the place, except the earthworks said to be Roman,
      is the Cross, which much resembles the more famous Cross of Ruthwell, near
      Dumfries, with the runes from the Song of the Rood. More fortunate than
      the Ruthwell relic of early Anglican Christianity, that of Bewcastle was
      never broken up by the bigots of the Covenant as "a monument of idolatry."
      The head, however, was removed by Belted Will of Naworth, and sent to
      Camden the historian, in the reign of James VI and I. The west face is the
      most interesting. The top panel contains a figure of St. John the Baptist;
      our Lord is represented in the central panel, inscribed in runes, <i>Gessus

      Bewcastle must, it seems, have been a more important and populous place
      when this monument was erected, than even when the Royal castle was a
      centre of resistance to the Riddesdale clans in Queen Elizabeth's day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning from Bewcastle by Penton, we strike the Riddel near Penton Linn,
      not distant from the vanished peel of that Judas, Hector Armstrong of
      Harelaw, who betrayed the Earl of Northumberland into the hands of the
      Regent Murray in 1569. A little way below, near the junction of Riddel and
      Esk, on a commanding height that overhangs railway and river, is Riddel
      Moat. Locally this moat is called "the Roman Camp," but to the average
      amateur there is certainly nothing Roman about it. No doubt the Romans may
      have had an outpost here; the position is too strong not to have been held
      by them, especially as they had a station barely a couple of miles away,
      at Netherby. But the prominent remains of fortifications now to be seen
      here manifestly date from long after Roman days. It is, I believe, the
      site of the earliest Riddel Castle, erected by Ranulph de Soulis before
      either the Riddel Castle at Castleton, or Hermitage, was built. This
      Riddel Castle was razed to the ground, wiped out of existence, by the
      Scottish army under David Bruce, which invaded England in 1346 and was so
      totally routed at Neville's Cross a few weeks later. On his march
      southward, says Redpath, Bruce "took the fortress of Riddel and put the
      garrison to the sword,... spreading terror and desolation all round him in
      his progress through Cumberland." Liddel Moat is well worthy of a visit,
      but it is somewhat out of the beaten track and can only be reached by
      walking a little distance, preferably from the station at Biddings
      Junction. The position, defended on the landward side by an immensely deep
      moat, and on the other dropping almost sheer into the river&mdash;or
      rather, now, on to the intervening railway line&mdash;is a magnificent
      one, and the view obtained from the <span class="pagenum">416</span><a
      name="link416" id="link416"></a>highest point is very fine,&mdash;at one's
      feet, just beyond the two rivers, "Cannobie lea";

      A short way farther down the Esk is Netherby, headquarters of that clan
      whose peel towers once dotted this part of Cumberland and all the
      Debateable Land, and who in the early seventeenth century were so hardly
      used by James VI and I. They were no better, I suppose, than the others of
      that day, but they were no worse, and the story of their banishment is not
      very pleasant reading. Lord Scrope believed that the Grahams were "privy"
      to Buccleuch's rescue of Kinmont Willie, and certainly the Grahams did not
      love Lord Scrope, who, I suppose, was not likely to present the clan in a
      very favourable light to Queen Elizabeth. Their reputation, in any case,
      became increasingly black, and James I, when he came to the throne, issued
      a proclamation against them. In fact, the dog was given an exceedingly bad
      name&mdash;not of course wholly without cause&mdash;and hung; or, rather,
      many of their houses were harried, their women and children turned out to
      fend for themselves in the wet and cold, and their men shipped off to
      banishment in Ireland and in Holland. Certainly, in driblets they made
      their way back to their own country again, after a time&mdash;those who
      survived, that is,&mdash;but their nests had been harried, their broods
      scattered down the wind, and, as a clan, their old status was never
      regained.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has already been told, Netherby was the site of a Roman station, and it
      is rich in evidences of the old Legions&mdash;coins, altars, and what not.
      The original peel at Netherby&mdash;which still forms part of the present
      mansion&mdash;I take to have been such another as the Graham tower of Kirk
      Andrews, its near neighbour, which stands&mdash;still inhabited&mdash;just
      across the Esk, perched on a rising ground overhanging the river. <span
      class="pagenum">417</span><a name="link417" id="link417"></a>From a

      In his Notes to "Redgauntlet," Sir Walter Scott mentions that "shortly
      after the close of the American war, Sir James Graham of Netherby
      constructed a dam-dike, or cauld, across the Esk, at a place where it
      flowed through his estate, though it has its origin, and the principal
      part of its course, in Scotland. The new barrier at Netherby was
      considered as an encroachment calculated to prevent the salmon from
      ascending into Scotland; and the right of erecting it being an
      international question of law betwixt the sister kingdoms, there was no
      court in either competent to its decision. In this dilemma, the Scots
      people assembled in numbers by signal of rocket-lights, and, rudely armed
      with fowling-pieces, fish spears and such rustic weapons, marched to the
      banks of the river for <span class="pagenum">418</span><a name="link418"
      id="link418"></a>the purpose of pulling down the dam dike objected to. Sir
      James Graham armed many of his own people to protect his property, and had
      some military from Carlisle for the same purpose. A renewal of the Border
      wars had nearly taken place in the eighteenth century, when prudence and
      moderation on both sides saved much tumult, and perhaps some bloodshed.
      The English proprietor consented that a breach should be made in his
      dam-dike sufficient for the passage of the fish, and thus removed the
      Scottish grievance. I believe the river has since that time taken the
      matter into its own disposal, and entirely swept away the dam-dike in
      question." I do not think there is now any trace of the obstruction which
      so roused the good people of Langholm and their supporters The question,
      of course, was not a new one. As early as the middle of the fifteenth
      century, Cumberland folks and Scots were at loggerheads over a
      "fish-garth" constructed by the former, which the Scots maintained
      prevented salmon from ascending to the upper waters. The dispute raged for
      something like a hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Kirk Andrews, we get at once onto the old London and Edinburgh
      coach road close to Scot's Dike, and in the course of two or three miles
      reach the village of Canonbie, where at a little distance from the bridge
      over Esk stands the comfortable old coaching inn, the Cross Keys, now
      favoured of anglers. Thence all the way to Langholm the road runs by the
      river-bank through very delightful scenery, said, in old days, indeed, to
      be the most beautiful of all between London and Edinburgh. In the twelfth
      century a Priory stood at Canonbie, and as late as 1576 there was still a
      resident Prior, but the building itself I think was wrecked by the English
      in 1542, after the battle of Solway Moss. A few of its stones are still to
      the fore, but I fear the ruin was used as a quarry during the building of
      Canonbie Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That also is a fate that waited on another famous building not far from
      Canonbie&mdash;Gilnockie Castle, the residence of the <span class="pagenum">419</span><a
      name="link419" id="link419"></a>notorious Johnny Armstrong. Hollows Tower,
      a few hundred yards above the village of Hollows, is often confounded with
      Gilnockie, probably for the reason that no stone of the latter has been
      left standing on another, and that Hollows Tower is a conspicuous object
      in the foreground here.

      Perhaps, too, Sir Walter Scott was partly responsible for the belief
      prevalent in many quarters that the Hollows is Gilnockie. In "Minstrelsy
      of the Scottish Border," he says: "His [Johny Armstrong's] <span
      class="pagenum">420</span><a name="link420" id="link420"></a>place of
      residence (now a roofless tower) was at the Hollows, a few miles from
      Langholm, where its rains still serve to adorn a scene which, in natural
      beauty, has few equals in Scotland."

    <p>
      I am not certain, but I do not think that Sir Walter ever visited
      Gilnockie. If he had done so, it could scarcely have escaped his knowledge
      that another castle once stood less than half a <span class="pagenum">421</span><a
      name="link421" id="link421"></a>mile from Hollows Tower, and that towards
      the end of the eighteenth century the stones from that castle were
      utilised in the building of Gilnockie Bridge. That they were so used is
      well authenticated; and I should think it is probable that the ruin was
      found to be a convenient quarry also when houses in the neighbouring
      village of Hollows were being built.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollows lower is a very good example of the old Border Keep, but it is
      small, much too small to have given anything like sufficient accommodation
      for Johny Armstrong's "tail," which must necessarily have been of
      considerable strength. The dining hall, for instance, measures roughly
      only a little over twenty-two feet by thirteen, and the total outside
      length of the tower is less than thirty-five feet. I should imagine it to
      be certain that Johny never lived here; indeed. I should be inclined to
      doubt if this particular Hollows Tower was even built during Johny
      Armstrong's life-time. Neither is the position a very strong one,&mdash;though
      on that point it is perhaps not easy to judge, because, in old days no
      doubt (as in the case of Hermitage Castle,) impassable swamps probably
      helped to protect it from assault on one or more sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place where Gilnockie stood is without any doubt a little lower down
      the Esk than Hollows Tower, at a point where the river makes a serpentine
      bend and contracts into a narrow, rocky gorge, impossible to ford. Here,
      at the Carlisle end of Gilnockie Bridge, on the high tongue of rocky land
      that projects into the stream, are faint but unmistakeable outlines of a
      large building, with outworks. The position is magnificent&mdash;impregnable,
      in fact, to any force of olden days unprovided with artillery. On three
      sides the rocky banks drop nearly sheer to the water, and across the root
      of the tongue are indications of a protecting fosse. It is impossible to
      imagine a site more perfect for a freebooter's stronghold. To have
      neglected it, in favour of such a position as that occupied by the Hollows
      Tower, would have been on the reiver's part to throw away the most obvious
      of the gifts of Providence. <span class="pagenum">422</span><a
      name="link422" id="link422"></a>Local tradition has it that Johny had a
      drawbridge by which, at will, he could cross the river.

      Certainly there is a projecting nose of rock just at the narrowest part of
      the stream, immediately above the present stone bridge, but one would be
      inclined to doubt if the engineering skill of Scotland in the <span
      class="pagenum">423</span><a name="link423" id="link423"></a>sixteenth
      century was equal to the task of constructing a serviceable drawbridge
      capable of spanning a width so great.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, is a curious stone that projects <i>inwards</i> from high up in
      Hollows Tower, the original purpose of which forms to the amateur lover of
      ancient buildings a quite insolvable puzzle. The stone measures, roughly,
      from the wall to its tip about three feet in length, and its diameter is
      perhaps ten or twelve inches. Towards the end farthest from the wall it
      has a well-marked groove on the upper part and sides, as if heavy weights
      had frequently been suspended from it by ropes or chains. Its position is
      on the light of a narrow door that opens two or three feet above the
      floor-level of the room into which the stone projects, and the stone
      itself must have been close to the ceiling of the chamber. What was its
      use? An intelligent but youthful guide, when the writer was at Hollows,
      suggested with ghoulish delight that it was "a hangin'-stane." But that,
      surely, would have been wilful waste on the part of the Armstrongs, so
      long as trees were available. Nor is it likely that they got rid of
      prisoners in this way with a regularity sufficient to account for the well
      worn groove in the stone. It does, however, recall Sir Thomas Dick
      Lauder's feelings, when "at the top of the south-western angle of the
      Tower [of Neidpath], a large mass of the masonry had fallen, and laid open
      a chamber roofed with a Gothic arch of stone, from the centre of which
      swung, vibrating with every heavy gust of wind, an enormous iron ring. To
      what strange and wild horrors did this not awaken the fancy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      From a little beyond Hollows Tower, all the way to Langholm you catch
      through the trees glimpses of hurrying, foamfleckcd streams that speak
      most eloquently of "sea-trout, rushing at the fly." It has never been the
      writer's fortune to cast a line in this water, but if looks go for
      anything the sport must be excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to imagine scenery more pleasing than the woody banks
      that overhang the river as Langholm is <span class="pagenum">424</span><a
      name="link424" id="link424"></a>approached; and the position of the town
      itself, nestling amongst beautiful hills, is singularly inviting. Langholm
      occupies the site of a famous old battle, that of Arkenholm, where in 1454
      the power of the Douglas's was finally broken.

      In and about the town there is much to interest those whose tastes lean
      towards archaeology; the whole countryside, indeed, is sprinkled with
      towers and the remains of towers. In the burgh itself for example, there
      is what appears to be the remains of an old peel, now forming part of the
      wing of a hotel; just above the upper bridge are the ruins&mdash;the
      sorely battered ruins&mdash;of Langholm Castle, once an Armstrong
      stronghold; and most beautifully situated on Wauchope Water, just outside
      the town, is Wauchope Castle, long ago the seat of the Lindsays. Little
      now is left of the building, practically nothing, indeed, but two small
      portions of the outer wall on the rocks <span class="pagenum">425</span><a
      name="link425" id="link425"></a>immediately overhanging the picturesque
      water of Wauchope. The position must in the days of its pride have been
      immensely strong, and the scene now is very beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In close proximity to the castle is an old graveyard, with remains&mdash;at
      least the foundations&mdash;of a pre-Reformation church and a few
      interesting old stones, two, at least, apparently very ancient, if one may
      judge from the style of sword cut on them. Not far from this are traces of
      the old Roman Road, and near at hand a stone bridge, also believed to be
      Roman, once crossed the stream. But it is said&mdash;with what truth I
      know not&mdash;to have been destroyed long ago by a Minister, whose care
      of his flock was such that, to prevent the lads of Langholm strolling that
      way of an evening, disturbing the peace of mind and pious meditations of
      his female domestics, he demolished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the case of Selkirk, and of Hawick, the great festival of the year
      at Langholm is on the occasion of the Fair and Common Riding. In the
      Proclamation of the Fair, after a statement of the penalties to be imposed
      on disturbers of the festival, the curious words occur: "They shall sit
      down on their bare knees and pray seven times for the King, and thrice for
      the Muckle Laird o' Ralton." The Laird of Ralton was an illegitimate son
      of Charles II, but what he had to do with Eskdale, or what is the origin
      of the words, I have been quite unable to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go, even superficially, into the history of Langholm and of the
      interesting and beautiful country surrounding it, would occupy much space,
      and neither time nor space is available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, amongst the hills and the many waters, we must leave the Border. It
      is a country whose mountains are seldom grand or awe-inspiring, as in some
      parts of the Scottish Highlands they may be; its streams do not flow with
      the rich majesty of Thames, nor with the mighty volume of Tay; and there
      are, doubtless, rivers possessed of wilder scenery. But to the true
      Borderer, however long absent he be, into what part <span class="pagenum">426</span><a
      name="link426" id="link426"></a>soever of the world he may have been
      driven by the Fates, there are no hills like the Border hills&mdash;they
      are indeed to him "the Delectable Mountains"; there are no waters so
      loved, none that sing to him so sweetly as Tweed and all the streams of
      his own land. "If I did not see the heather at least once a year, I think
      I should die," said Scott. To a greater or less extent it is so with all
      of us. One of her most loving sons (he who should have guided the course
      of this volume, and who, had he lived, would have made of it something
      worthy of the Border), once said, on his return from a visit to famed
      Killarney: "The beauty of the Irish Lakes is rather that of the
      Professional Beauty. When one comes back to the Border, there one finds
      the same beauty one used to see in the face of one's mother, or of one's
      old nurse." And: "I am never so happy as when I cross the Tweed at Berwick
      from the South," he writes in an Introduction to Mr. Charles Murray's
      "Plamewith." It was not only his own, but, I think, every Borderer's
      sentiments that he voiced when he wrote:
